Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs.\n\u2022 On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others' perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.",
        "reappraisal_response":"I see that you are struggling with your anger management issue, and you are stressed out about the impact that it brings on you and the people around you. I think it will be helpful for you to start with reassessing your current situation. You must put some effort into why and what makes you angry. Re-examine yourself as if you are somebody else, and try not to over-invest in the emotion you are feeling. What are the internal values or beliefs are these feelings are related to? (What do you think it's triggering or worsening your reaction?) By clearly identifying these causes, it will help you to manage your immediate reactions and consequences. I would also suggest you think, \u201cIs this all worth it?\u201d when this issue occurs again. Is this all worth the time and effort you put in to be a better self and build a good relationship with the people around you? I know this may sound too analytical, but I think you can do it because you realize that this is the cause of the problem that is stressing you out and stopping you from moving forward toward well-being so I think you can do it once you get the hang of managing these and make it into regular practice.

        "reappraisal_response":"Sure, here's a revised version of the reappraisal response that takes into account the narrator's ability to cope with the consequences of the event and the feedback provided:\n\nIt sounds like the narrator is feeling stuck in a difficult situation where their anger has caused issues in their relationships with family and friends, and their attempts to avoid arguments by distancing themselves have led to feelings of disconnection and isolation. However, the narrator has also been able to cope with the consequences of the event to some extent by learning to keep their anger to themselves and avoid engaging in discussions that might trigger their anger.\n\nOne potential reappraisal of the situation could be that the narrator's anger is not the root cause of the issues, but rather a symptom of deeper underlying issues. Perhaps the narrator's family and friends are trying to control their every decision because they are coming from a place of love and concern, but this is being misinterpreted by the narrator as criticism.\n\nAdditionally, the narrator's avoidance of arguments may be seen as a sign of strength and self-care, rather than a sign of weakness or failure. The narrator's desire to maintain healthy relationships is a positive goal, and there are many ways to achieve this beyond just avoiding arguments.\n\nBy reframing the situation in this way, the narrator may be able to approach their relationships with a more open and compassionate mindset, rather than feeling stuck in a cycle of anger and avoidance. The narrator's ability to cope with the consequences of the event and their desire to maintain healthy relationships suggests that they have the capacity to address the issues in their relationships and find a balance between managing their anger and maintaining their relationships.",

        "reappraisal_response":"Reappraisal Response: Based on your analysis, it appears that you are placing a significant amount of responsibility on yourself for the issues in your relationships with family and friends. However, it's important to recognize that not all of the responsibility lies with you. Instead of taking on all of the blame, focus on your own actions and reactions to the situations, and acknowledge that you cannot control the actions of others.\n\nHere are some specific guidelines that may be helpful:\n\n1. Practice self-compassion: It's okay to acknowledge that you are not perfect and have made mistakes, but don't beat yourself up over them. Recognize that you are doing the best you can.\n2. Set boundaries: Set clear boundaries with your family and friends to protect yourself from their critical and controlling behavior. This may involve taking a step back from certain situations or limiting the amount of time you spend with them.\n3. Practice assertive communication: Learn to communicate your needs and feelings in a assertive, yet respectful way. This can help you stand up for yourself and set boundaries without resorting to anger or aggression.\n4. Seek support: Seek support from trusted friends, family members, or a therapist to help you navigate these relationships and manage your emotions.\n\nTo begin addressing the issues in your relationships, start by focusing on the aspects that are within your control. Break down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect. For example, if you feel that your family and friends are too controlling, make a list of specific behaviors that you would like them to change. Then, communicate your needs and boundaries clearly and assertively.\n\nHowever, it's also important to examine whether the situation at hand is worth your attention. If the issue is not critical or if it's causing more stress than necessary, it may be better to focus on other important things. Find something that's easier and less stressful to tackle, and revisit the situation when you have more energy and resources.\n\nRemember to take joy in striking off items from your to-do list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, you will find yourself feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing each step, re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process as needed.",

        "reappraisal_response":"Reappraisal Response:\n\nIt seems like you're carrying a heavy burden of responsibility for your family's actions and decisions, which may not be entirely necessary. Instead of taking on their issues as your own, focus on your own well-being and boundaries. Here are specific guidelines to help you reappraise the situation and set healthy boundaries:\n\n1. Recognize your responsibility: You are responsible for your own actions and decisions, but not for your family's. Acknowledge what you can and cannot control.\n2. Set boundaries: Clearly communicate your limits to your family, and enforce them when necessary. This may involve taking a break from gatherings or discussions that trigger your anger.\n3. Practice self-care: Take care of your physical, emotional, and mental health. Engage in activities that bring you joy and help you manage stress.\n4. Seek support: Reach out to trusted friends, family members, or a therapist for support and guidance. Talking to someone who understands can help you process your emotions and gain a different perspective.\n5. Reframe negative thoughts: Challenge negative self-talk and reframe unhelpful beliefs. Instead of dwelling on what you can't control, focus on what you can control and what you've accomplished.\n\nTo address the issue at hand, start by breaking down the problem into manageable steps. Create a to-do list to tackle each aspect, and focus on one task at a time. As you accomplish each item, take joy in striking it off the list. This will empower you and help you regain control of the situation. If needed, re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process. Remember, you don't have to face this alone. Seek support from trusted friends, family members, or a therapist when needed.\n\nIn addition, it may be helpful to examine whether the situation at hand is worth your attention. If it's not, consider focusing on other important things that bring you joy and fulfillment. Sometimes, it's better to let go of situations that cause more harm than good. By taking a step back and reassessing the situation, you can regain control and find a more positive path forward.",

I am an adult, I should be past those embarrassing child-like behaviours. Besides, at my age i'm pretty sure this classifies as domestic violence.\nThroughout my life I had those minor outbursts of violence, where i bit people, kicked them etc. then in effort of stopping it, i turned to myself and whenever anger got too overwhelming i would hit myself on the head but that just made me look like i'm unhinged and crazy, so not ideal either. I stopped both of those behaviours 2-3 years ago and I just pinpointed it to teenage hormones\/rebellion. i was so sure i got a hold of my violent outbursts, put them past me. i was doing so well, those outbursts were no longer a thing, whenever i was about to throw a rage fit i managed to cool down. but today it came back all over again.\nnow i am seriously afraid I might hurt someone in the future out of anger. or even k*ll them. i'm legit afraid of myself. cause in the moment when i am angry, sometimes i experience such blinding rage that i seemingly can't stop myself.  i am so afraid that in the future i will hurt my potential boyfriend, friends, family. if this never stops, maybe someday i'll go to jail for abuse. i don't want that. i don't wanna be a bad person. i want to get better. \n\ni also feel very sorry and i wanna apologize to my mom. the deal is... she'll forgive me, of course she will, but i don't want to issue an empty apology without showing improvement first. words without improvement are worth nothing.\n\nany good techniques that will help me calm nerves in a heated moment fairly easily? i wanna be a good daughter so bad :(",

I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh. \n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, \"oh hes not that,\" and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking. They still slept over and I just want to crawl in a hole then to see them.",

        "reappraisal_response":"To address the narrator's anxiety about the job opportunity, it's important to remind them that they have control over their thoughts and actions. They can choose to focus on what they can control rather than worrying about things outside of their control. Additionally, the narrator has the option to communicate their decision to their employer and prioritize their own well-being. It's important to remind the narrator that they are not responsible for things they are not responsible for, and to not worry about them too much.\n\nTo manage their anxiety, the narrator can break down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect. If they feel overwhelmed to do this alone, they can look for support from friends\/family. Encouraging them to find joy in striking off items from their to-do list can help them feel empowered and in control. After accomplishing their tasks, they can re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process.\n\nIt's also important to acknowledge the narrator's feedback that they feel anxious about the job opportunity due to the lack of sleep and the high security of the datacenter. It's understandable that these factors could contribute to their anxiety. To address this, the narrator can try to prioritize their sleep and find ways to manage their anxiety, such as practicing relaxation techniques or seeking professional help if necessary. It's also important to remember that the job opportunity may not be worth sacrificing their well-being. Ultimately, the narrator should make a decision that aligns with their values and priorities. If the situation is not within their control, they should focus on other important things and find something that's easier and less stressful to tackle. Additionally, the narrator should recognize what is upsetting them and think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.",

Did you clearly communicate what you want and your objectives for this session? Is the therapist trying all sorts of different approaches that don't match what you have asked for? It could be due to many factors, and there are several steps that you both should work out throughout the sessions. Some people try different therapists to find one who best suits their needs and expertise. It's important to reassess and refocus your attention on what you truly need from therapy. So, I say keep trying, but since it's been two years and you don't see any hope with your current therapist, maybe it's time to search for a new one.",

        "reappraisal_response":"Sure, I'd be happy to help the narrator reappraise the situation!\n\nBased on the text, it seems that the narrator is experiencing a lot of stress and anxiety related to their upcoming exams. While it's understandable to feel pressure to do well, it's important to remember that you are not solely responsible for the outcome of these exams. Your level of responsibility is a 7 on the scale, as you have acknowledged that your anxiety is a contributing factor to your physical symptoms.\n\nHere are some realistic and specific guidelines to help you reappraise the situation and manage your stress:\n\n1. Practice self-care: Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating well, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation.\n2. Challenge negative thoughts: When you start to feel overwhelmed, take a step back and challenge any negative thoughts that come up. Ask yourself if there's evidence to support these thoughts, and try to reframe them in a more positive light.\n3. Focus on what you can control: Instead of worrying about the outcome of your exams, focus on what you can control - your preparation and effort.\n4. Seek support: Talk to friends, family, or a trusted adult about how you're feeling. It can be helpful to have someone to talk to who can offer support and perspective.\n5. Take breaks: It's important to give yourself time to rest and recharge. Take short breaks throughout the day to do something that brings you joy, like reading a book or taking a walk.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, it may be helpful to consider the areas where you have control and focus on those, rather than worrying about things that are outside of your control. For example, you can control your preparation and effort, but you cannot control the outcome of the exams. By focusing on what you can control, you can feel more in control and less overwhelmed.\n\nRemember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed and anxious at times. But by taking care of yourself and reappraising the situation, you can manage your stress and feel more in control. Good luck with your exams!",

It's understandable to feel anxious and stressed when facing high-stakes exams, but it's important to remember that you can only control your own efforts and performance.\n\nHere are some guidelines that may help you reappraise the situation and manage your stress:\n\n1. Focus on what you can control: Instead of worrying about the outcome of your exams or the grades you'll receive, focus on what you can control - your preparation and performance.

Nobody expects you to be perfect, and it's unlikely that you'll get straight A's without any mistakes. Remember that it's the effort you put in that matters, not the outcome.\n3. Practice self-compassion: Be kind to yourself and try not to beat yourself up over things that are outside of your control. Remember that you're doing your best, and that's something to be proud of.\n4. Seek support: Talk to friends, family, or a trusted adult about how you're feeling. Sometimes just sharing your concerns with someone who cares about you can help you feel better and gain perspective.\n5.

Based on the narrator's personal values of acceptance, understanding, and support for their children, it seems that they are being inconsistent in their support for a gay son versus a Christian son. While they express that they can understand being in love and being supportive of their son, regardless of his sexual orientation or religious beliefs, their personal values of atheism and the difficulty in connecting with someone who believes in God may create a slight inconsistency in their support for a Christian son.\n\nTo reappraise the situation, the narrator may want to consider the importance of acceptance and understanding of all individuals, regardless of their beliefs or backgrounds. By embracing these values, the narrator can provide a more consistent and supportive environment for both their gay and Christian sons. Additionally, the narrator may want to reflect on their personal values and how they align with their desired support for their children. By examining their own biases and assumptions, the narrator can work towards providing a more inclusive and accepting support system for all of their children.",

Rather, it is an opportunity for them to practice empathy, understanding, and unconditional love. By setting aside their own preconceptions and embracing their son's individuality, the narrator can foster a more inclusive and supportive environment for their son to thrive.\n\nThe narrator believes they have some ability to cope with the situation, but may need to work on their ability to understand and support their son's beliefs. By acknowledging their own limitations and being open to reevaluating their perspective, the narrator can take a step towards a more selfless and supportive approach.\n\nNA (Not Addressed)\n\nThe text does not address the narrator's level of responsibility for the situation, as the focus is solely on their personal biases and how they might affect their relationship with their son. However, by acknowledging their own limitations and being open to reevaluating their perspective, the narrator can take a step towards a more selfless and supportive approach.\n\nIn addition, the narrator's self-acknowledged difficulty in understanding their son's Christian beliefs may require further attention to fully address the situation. The narrator may benefit from actively seeking out information and perspectives that challenge their own beliefs and biases, in order to better understand and support their son.

They acknowledge that they cannot understand their son's beliefs, but they also recognize that they can still be supportive of him. They express a desire to be understanding and accepting of their son, regardless of his beliefs. However, they also acknowledge that they may have difficulty connecting with their son if he is Christian, which suggests that they may have some limitations in their ability to control the situation.

        "reappraisal_response":"Reappraisal Response:\n\nIt seems that you are struggling with the idea of supporting a Christian son due to your own lack of belief in God. As a neutral third party, I would suggest that you take a step back and re-evaluate your level of responsibility in the situation. Rather than focusing on the aspects of the situation that are outside of your control, such as your son's beliefs or identities, I suggest you focus on the aspects that are within your control. For example, you can focus on being a supportive and accepting parent to both of your children, regardless of their beliefs or identities. This can involve actively listening to them, providing a safe and welcoming space for them to express themselves, and offering support and resources as needed.\n\nAdditionally, you might consider examining whether this situation is worth your attention. If it's not, you may want to focus on other important things in your life that bring you joy and fulfillment. It's important to prioritize your own well-being and avoid getting bogged down in situations that cause you unnecessary stress.\n\nIn terms of control, the situation is partially within your control. You can choose how you respond to your son's beliefs and how you support him, but you cannot control his beliefs or identities themselves. By focusing on what you can control and taking steps to address your negative emotions, you can find a sense of agency and empowerment in this situation.\n\nIt's important to recognize that conflicts of internal values may arise in situations where multiple people interact. Your personal values of acceptance and support for your children are consistent with the situation, but your difficulty in connecting with your son if he were to become a Christian suggests that your personal values of secularism and atheism may be less consistent with the situation. By acknowledging and addressing these values, you can better support your son and find a sense of empowerment in the situation.\n\nWhen communicating with others, it's essential to be mindful of their perspectives and backgrounds. If the situation aligns with your beliefs, it's important to communicate amicably with others. However, if the situation contradicts your beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others' perspectives.

        "reappraisal_response":"Based on your text, it seems that you are placing a high level of responsibility on yourself to be supportive of your future son's identity, regardless of whether he is gay or Christian. While it's understandable to want to be supportive, it's important to recognize that your son's identity and beliefs are his own to claim and own, and it's not entirely up to you to determine how much support he needs.\n\nIt's also important to acknowledge that your son's identity and beliefs may be different from your own, and that's okay. Instead of trying to control or change his identity, focus on being a positive influence and a source of support. Recognize that you don't have to have all the answers or fully understand your son's identity to be a supportive parent. Simply being open to his experiences and perspectives can make a world of difference.\n\nIn situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. It's important to communicate amicably with others and acknowledge their perspectives, even if they contradict your beliefs. For instance, if you firmly believe that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of other viewpoints, even if they disagree with your own.\n\nTo reduce negative emotions and avoid situations that may trigger upset, you could start by examining whether this situation is worth your attention. If it's not, consider focusing on other important things that bring you joy and fulfillment. If you do decide to focus on being a supportive parent, start by identifying specific actions you can take to embody open-mindedness, listening, and love and acceptance. For example, you could attend LGBTQ+ events or read about Christianity to better understand your son's beliefs.\n\nRemember that it's okay to not fully understand or agree with your son's choices, and that's not a reflection of your own worth as a parent. Instead of trying to control or change his identity, focus on being a positive influence and a source of support. By taking a step back and focusing on being a supportive and loving parent, you can reduce negative emotions and create a more positive and inclusive environment for your son to grow and thrive.",

As a parent, your role is to provide love and support for your daughter. By following through with the pediatrician's recommendation, you're taking a step you can control to help her development.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider whether the worry you're feeling is proportionate to the situation. Early intervention is a common and often very successful approach to such concerns, and many children benefit greatly from it. If you find that your concern is overwhelming, it may be helpful to shift your focus to other important aspects of your life and your child's life that are going well. Engage in activities that you and your children enjoy and that bring you peace. This can help create a balanced perspective and reduce stress.\n\nBreak down the process into manageable steps, such as scheduling the first appointment or researching what to expect during early intervention. Each step you complete is progress, and with each accomplishment, you'll gain confidence and a sense of control.

        "reappraisal_response":"Our son was born 8 weeks early, so we had early intervention services every other week until he was caught up (at about 8 months). \n\nIt can't hurt. I know what you're going through is scary; it will probably help to have someone come out and quantify where you are right now -- whether your daughter is actually delayed, and how much. The early intervention people will probably play with your daughter and check how she responds to different stimuli, and also talk to you to see what is normal for her and what she is\/isn't doing. Then, together you will come up with a plan: how often they will come out, what they expect, what they will do. With our son, they did stretches, and had him work on sitting (especially transverse muscles -- pulling up diagonally). \n\nThere's usually a sliding scale, and possibly health insurance coverage (or state coverage) for early intervention. So I encourage you to take advantage of the program. Ultimately, it wasn't very useful for us, but I can see that for slightly older babies there's more to do, and it was nice having someone come out to work with our son and keep track of his development. They also offered baby massage courses for free, but we didn't use them...\n\nGood luck! I hope everything turns out well for you and your twins.",

        "reappraisal_response":"I think it's important to focus on the situation at hand. I know it can be upsetting to have someone approach you and say such a thing when you are doing what mothers are supposed to do, which is a natural and cautious behavior. While it may still seem inappropriate to some people, especially those who do not have children, this doesn't mean that what you did was inappropriate. So, I think it may be wise to research whether breastfeeding is legally protected in the area\/country you live in.

Granted, I did not have a cover (forgot it) but was sitting discretely and had a shirt on that hid most everything.\nA barista came over and asked that I use the Family Room (washroom with change table, microwave and lazy boy chair) to do feedings, as it was \"potentially unhygienic\" and \"other patrons may be uncomfortable.\" She also said that is what the room is designed for.\n\nSince this is an independent store, do they have the right to make this request? They didn't tell me I had to leave, just go to a different area. My friend said it would be no different than being in a mall where there is a place to eat (food court) but individual stores can tell you not to bring food in.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

I suspect the answer you would get would be somewhat different if you asked the general public.\n\nI don't have any legal advice to offer you, but I will note that what is legal is not necessarily morally right on the one hand or socially acceptable on the other. So don't just look at it through a legal lens. \n\nMy personal thought is that if the room they offered you was clean and had what you needed and if they asked respectfully, their request was reasonable. Breastfeeding is a laudable practice, but doing it in public does make many non-parents uncomfortable, due to the strong nudity taboo in American society. \n\nIf you feel that this incident left you with a bad taste in your mouth (which it sounds like it did), then I wouldn't go to that shop again, and instead find some more parent-friendly establishment.\n\nHope that helps!",

So I know you said you don't want any advice, so don't take this as an advice-I'm not saying you should do it- but just in case you are curious how others do it and maybe sometime in the future or suddenly out of the blue you decide to do it- then maybe think of this: acknowledge that you have so much in your burden. You are already in isolation- that's a big stressor for ANYONE. You don't have someone to talk to whenever you are feeling stressed daily-whether it is a minor or a major thing. That little amount of stress build up and later become depression, I think. Second, you are also feeling stressed at work, and this is even much more stressful because most of the time, stress from work happens not just in my control but also from others: your manager, boss, college, or any other uncontrollable things. So, I think it is wiser that you acknowledge that you are already handling too much of what you can afford to do alone. Why not start with just one simple step and maybe think about the other stuff later? Living alone, is there anything you can do something about this?

If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don't hesitate to look for support from friends\/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list.\n\u2022 A good response should also encourage the narrator to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!",
        "reappraisal_response":"I understand your fears. Your feelings are valid, as another wave is coming and it's too soon to know how it's gonna go.\n\nHowever, it's still a bit early to panic. Israel reimposed their mask mandates out of precaution, because they don't know how many of the new cases will translate into hospitalizations and deaths. Most likely, little of them will, but until they know for sure, the safe thing to do is to add some public health measures. My prediction is that this wave isn't gonna last very long, but it's gonna induce a lot of anxiety as it starts.\n\nAlso, I doubt there's any situation where we \"never\" will get back to normal. Worst case scenario, the return to normality will be delayed until more countries are vaccinated. From what I understand, this wave in Israel is caused mostly by unvaccinated tourists. Like the WHO said, \"no one is safe until everyone is safe\". But as more and more people in the world get vaccinated, it's gonna get better and new variants will stop popping up so often.\n\nIn the meantime, if mask mandates are the only restrictions left, in my opinion, it's still a major win compared to 2020.",

It is also important to follow any local guidelines or recommendations regarding travel and social gatherings. Ultimately, the decision to visit your family now is up to you and should be based on your own personal comfort level and risk tolerance. If you feel overwhelmed to tackle this issue alone, don't hesitate to look for support from friends\/family. Focus on breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect. Encourage yourself to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. After accomplishing them, re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process. If the situation is not worth your attention, consider focusing on other important things that are less stressful to tackle. Additionally, it is important to recognize and address any negative emotions that may be causing stress and take steps to reduce or control them. This can include finding ways to avoid or reduce exposure to triggers, seeking support from friends or a therapist, and practicing relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or meditation.",

        "reappraisal_response":"Based on your analysis, it seems that the narrator is moderately responsible (7) for their current situation, but may be overestimating their level of responsibility and worrying about things that are outside of their control. To help the narrator reappraise the situation, it may be helpful to focus on the following guidelines:\n\n1. Identify what you can control: Focus on your attitude, work ethic, and relationships. Let go of things outside of your control.\n2. Practice self-compassion: Be kind to yourself and reframe negative thoughts. Everyone makes mistakes and has setbacks.\n3. Set realistic goals: Break down goals into achievable steps. This can help you feel a sense of accomplishment and progress.\n4. Seek support: Talk to trusted friends, family, or a therapist about your feelings. Sometimes just talking through emotions can help you gain perspective.\n\nHowever, it's also important to examine whether the situation at hand is worth your attention. If it's not, consider focusing on other important things that bring you joy and fulfillment. Sometimes, it's better to let go of things that are not serving you and focus on what truly matters.\n\nIn terms of taking control of the situation, you could start by breaking down the problem into manageable steps and developing a detailed plan to tackle each aspect. This could be as simple as creating a to-do list and focusing on one task at a time. As you make progress, you can re-evaluate the situation and adjust your approach as needed.\n\nAdditionally, you may find it helpful to recognize that you have already been taking steps to cope with the situation, such as trying to distract yourself and go out. While these efforts may not be completely effective, they do indicate a willingness to take action and manage your situation. By acknowledging and building on these efforts, you may be able to further develop your coping strategies and improve your ability to handle the consequences of the event.",

Assess your control: Evaluate what you can control in this situation and what you cannot. Focus on what you can control and break it down into smaller, manageable steps.\n3. Create a plan: Develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect of the problem. This could be as simple as a to-do list, but make sure it's specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).\n4. Take action: Start taking action on your plan, one step at a time. Focus on the task at hand and take joy in striking off items from your to-do list.\n5. Re-evaluate: After accomplishing each step, re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process if needed.\n\nHowever, it's also important to examine whether the situation at hand is worth your attention. If it's not, consider finding something easier and less stressful to tackle. Remember, you have the power to choose how you spend your time and energy. If the situation is too stressful or overwhelming, consider using healthy coping mechanisms such as exercise, meditation, or talking to a friend or family member to manage your stress and anxiety. By taking this into account, you can maintain a sense of hope and motivation while also being realistic about your limits.\n\nIn addition, it may be helpful for you to recognize what is upsetting you and find ways to reduce negative emotions, control your feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset you. This can help you maintain a positive outlook and stay motivated to tackle the situation.\n\nBy breaking down the problem into manageable steps and taking action on your plan, you'll feel more in control and empowered to tackle the situation. Remember to focus on the progress you make, no matter how small, and",

        "reappraisal_response":"Based on your text, it seems that you are feeling overwhelmed by the Delta Variant reports and the responsibility you feel for keeping up with them. Here are some suggestions to help you reappraise the situation and manage your stress:\n\n1. Focus on what you can control: Instead of feeling responsible for the entire pandemic, focus on what you can control, such as staying informed, taking precautions, and supporting others. Break down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect.\n2. Prioritize self-care: Take breaks from reading about the pandemic and focus on activities that bring you joy and relaxation. Practice self-compassion and prioritize your mental and physical health.\n3. Set boundaries: Decide what you can realistically handle and set boundaries with others about what you are willing to do. Learn to say \"no\" when necessary.\n4. Seek support: Talk to trusted friends, family, or a therapist about your feelings. Sharing your concerns with others can help you feel less alone and more supported.\n5. Practice gratitude: Reflect on the things you are grateful for, such as your health, relationships, and the progress made in vaccination efforts. Focusing on the positive can help shift your perspective.\n\nIn addition, it may be helpful to recognize what is upsetting you about the situation and take steps to reduce your exposure to those triggers. This could include limiting your consumption of news reports or taking a break from social media.

        "reappraisal_response":"Sure, here's the revised reappraisal response based on the feedback:\n\n\"It's understandable that you feel responsible for the situation, but it's important to remember that you are not completely in control of your mother's beliefs and actions. You have tried your best to debunk the situation and figure things out, but sometimes, despite our best efforts, things don't go as planned. It's okay to acknowledge that you are not responsible for your mother's beliefs and that you have done what you can to address the situation. It might be helpful to focus on what you can control, such as taking care of yourself and seeking support from others, rather than taking on too much responsibility for the situation as a whole. Remember that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and powerless in the face of difficult situations, but it's important to take care of yourself and seek support when needed. It's also important to recognize that you have already invested a significant amount of time and effort into addressing the situation, and that it's okay to take a step back and prioritize your own well-being.\"\n\n<Likert>8<\/Likert>\n\nThe narrator thought that further attention was completely needed (9) to address the situation. The text highlights the narrator's feelings of helplessness, depression, and misery, indicating a high level of emotional investment in finding a resolution. Additionally, the narrator mentions that they have tried \"pouring [their] heart and soul\" into figuring things out, suggesting a significant amount of time and effort has already been devoted to addressing the situation. The narrator also expresses a desire for full approval to come soon, indicating a sense of urgency and the belief that a resolution is necessary. Overall, the narrator's emotional state and actions suggest that they believe further attention is necessary to address the situation.",

To reappraise the situation and reduce stress, the narrator should focus on what they can control, such as their own reactions and responses. Here are some guidelines that may help:\n\n1. Examine the situation: Before investing more time and energy, the narrator should evaluate whether the situation is worth their attention. If it's not, they should focus on other important things.\n2. Prioritize self-care: The narrator should prioritize self-care and self-compassion to protect their well-being.\n3. Set boundaries: The narrator should establish clear expectations for how they want to be treated and prioritize their own needs.\n4. Seek support: The narrator should reach out to trusted friends, family members, or a therapist for support and guidance.\n\nBy focusing on what they can control, the narrator can regain a sense of agency and empowerment in this situation. They should start by examining the situation, prioritizing self-care, setting boundaries, and seeking support.

To regain a sense of control and balance, focus on what you can control and break down the problem into manageable steps. Ask yourself: what specific actions can I take to support my mother?\n\nStart by creating a to-do list and prioritizing the tasks based on their importance and urgency. This will help you tackle the issue piece by piece and make progress, no matter how small. As you complete each task, take joy in striking it off your list, and remember that each accomplishment brings you closer to your goal.\n\nAdditionally, don't be afraid to seek support from trusted friends and family. They may be able to offer valuable insights, provide emotional support, or help with specific tasks. By leaning on others when needed, you can distribute the weight of responsibility and find a sense of balance.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider whether the situation is worth your attention. If it's not, it may be helpful to focus on other important things in your life. Sometimes, letting go of a situation can be the most empowering thing you can do. If you find that this situation is not worth your attention, consider finding something easier and less stressful to tackle.\n\nRemember, you can't control everything, but by focusing on what you can control, taking care of yourself, and seeking support when needed, you can find a sense of empowerment and take steps towards a resolution.",

But here's the thing: even though you may not be able to control everything that's happening, you do have some agency and power in this situation.

That takes a lot of courage and strength, and it's something to be proud of.\n\nInstead of focusing on what you can't control, maybe try to focus on what you can control. For example, you can control how you respond to your mom and how you take care of yourself during this difficult time. You can also control how you choose to spend your time and energy, and what resources you use to support yourself.

Based on the information provided, it seems that the narrator is feeling overwhelmed and helpless in the face of their mother's lies and deception.\n\nHere are some suggestions for how the narrator might reappraise the situation and regain a sense of control:\n\n1. Face the situation directly: Instead of avoiding the situation or pretending that everything is okay, the narrator could try to confront their mother and the situation head-on. This might involve having an honest conversation with their mother, seeking out support from trusted friends or family members, or seeking the help of a professional, such as a therapist or counselor.\n2. Seek help from others: The narrator does not have to go through this alone. Seeking out support from close friends, family members, or professionals can provide a sense of validation and help the narrator feel less isolated.\n3. Take a mental break: It's important to take care of oneself during difficult times. The narrator might consider taking a break from the situation and doing something that brings them joy and relaxation. This could be anything from going for a walk, to reading a book, to practicing meditation or yoga.\n4. Re-evaluate the situation: Once the narrator has taken some time to recharge and reflect on the situation, they might consider re-evaluating the situation and their role in it. This might involve identifying any areas where they do have control and taking action to address those areas.\n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful. Remember, it's important to take care of oneself during difficult times and to seek out support from trusted friends, family members, or professionals when needed.",

My wife and I are moving to the UK from South Korea this month and are in a tight position regarding vaccination - we could technically get our first jab in Korea but dont have enough time to get both. We have been struggling to decide on what to do for two reasons. 1) is it even possible to get to the UK and say hey I have already got one jab from maker X so please just give me the second one 2) would it be possible to get a vaccine passport like this? I fear that with countries not recognizing vaccination abroad we would be stuck in this limbo of not being believed by either the UK or South Korea Anyone has a similar experience? What did you end up doing? If it were 1 month ago we would have no problems just having two jabs in the UK but given the current situation, flying in without a minimum level of immunity sounds crazy",

They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1\/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall\/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to. I feel like I've become so negative that I don't want to share my thoughts with people because I will bring them down, and I already feel like I pushed some people away by doing this. I emailed multiple psychiatrists, but only one answered me and had one short appointment, and told me I should continue looking because he doesn't have time for new patients. I spend most of my time trying to get the motivation to work but failing, and looking at vaccination percentages and restrictions around the world hoping to see them improve and thinking about where else can be better than here.",

Taking this into account, the narrator should focus on breaking down the problem into manageable steps and developing a detailed plan to tackle each aspect. If they feel overwhelmed to do this alone, they should not hesitate to look for support from friends\/family. Encouraging them to find joy in striking off items from their to-do list can help them feel empowered and in control. After accomplishing each task, they should re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process.\n\nIt's also important for the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it's not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that's easier and less stressful to tackle. Additionally, it's important to note that the situation is not entirely within the narrator's control, and it's important to accept this and focus on what they can control.",

They have been following the COVID rules and guidelines, but are still concerned about the delta variant and the potential for future lockdowns.\n\nTo help the narrator reappraise the situation, I would suggest that they focus on the things that they can control, rather than getting bogged down in worries about the future. For example, they could start by making a list of the things that they can do to protect themselves and their loved ones from the virus, such as washing their hands regularly, wearing a mask in public, and staying informed about the latest guidance from public health officials.\n\nOnce they have identified these tasks, they can break them down into smaller, manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each one. This could include things like scheduling regular hand-washing breaks, finding a reliable source for masks, and setting up a system for staying informed about the latest guidance.\n\nAdditionally, I would encourage the narrator to reach out to friends and family for support, as having a support system can make a big difference in helping to cope with the stress and uncertainty of the pandemic.\n\nFinally, I would suggest that the narrator focus on the accomplishments they make, rather than getting overwhelmed by the scope of the issue. By breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable steps and taking action on each one, they will find that they are able to make progress and feel more in control of their situation.

It's also important to remember that the situation is constantly changing, and it's possible that things may improve or worsen depending on various factors. While the narrator did not explicitly state whether they thought they were able to control the situation, it's important to note that individuals have varying levels of control over the circumstances around them, and it's important to take responsibility for one's own health and well-being.<\/rationale>",

I think it's good to start with something low-maintenance like a fish, which could definitely be within your control. It will be a better way to teach your son empathy and responsibility toward a living thing. Dogs are great too, but I would suggest you think more before getting one because they tend to require much more training and cost when co-living with a baby (although they are great!). I think it's definitely up to you and your current situation whether you can afford it or not, but both options seem great to me.",
