I'm straight, but I can understand being in love, and I think I could deal with the first time my son brings home a boyfriend if he turns out to be gay. As an atheist, though, I can't understand believing in God, and I think if he turns out to be Christian, it would be hard for me to be supportive. He'd have more community support as a Christian, but I feel like it would be harder to connect with him myself.\n\nIs this selfish?","Reddit ID":"kksfe","Dimension":23,"Reappraisal":"Hi.it’s understandable to feel confused and surprised to encounter something unexpected. I think you are being a good mom supporting what your son believes regardless what you believe for yourself. Again, religion can be something that could either tear people apart but I think you are trying and making effort to understand and respect your sons’ decision. So I suggest that it’ll be helpful to step back and understand the perspectives of others. This doesn’t mean you have to change your beliefs, but rather acknowledge that different viewpoints exist. ","evaluation_raw_output_dim_1":"<score>7<\/score><rationale>The response does a decent job of guiding the narrator to understand that conflicts of internal values may arise in situations where multiple people interact. It encourages the narrator to respect their son's decision and understand the perspectives of others. However, it could have been more explicit in reminding the narrator about the importance of re-appraising the situation when it contradicts their beliefs. The response could also have been more specific and tailored to the narrator's situation, rather than offering somewhat generic advice.<\/rationale>"}
{"Reddit Post":"Does anyone find their anxiety worse when they lack sleep? How to get past it?  I have an optional job that's gonna start at 4am until 8am for one day. I don't think I will be able to sleep at all until the job is finished. It's at a datacenter so it makes me feel trapped because of the high security and the cold. Which is just going to contribute to the anxiety. I want to go because it sounds interesting but at the same time, I'm afraid it's gonna be too much for me to handle. And I'm given the option to not go, if I just lie and say I have something else to do on that day","Reddit ID":"Anxiety_13","Dimension":8,"Reappraisal":"Okay, I think you should keep your job to maintain financial stability and keep your life intact. Is the job only from 4 to 8 am? I understand it might be difficult, but adjusting your routine to fit this schedule could be wise. What about going to bed early, say around 6 pm? This would allow you to wake up early and get enough sleep. While it may still be exhausting, this approach should help you get enough rest to prevent excessive anxiety.","evaluation_raw_output_dim_1":"<score>8<\/score><rationale>The response does a good job of addressing the narrator's concerns about their ability to control the situation. It acknowledges the narrator's anxiety about the job and provides a specific suggestion on how to manage the situation - adjusting their sleep schedule. However, it does not fully address the narrator's fear of feeling trapped in the datacenter, which is a significant part of the anxiety they're experiencing. The response could have suggested ways to cope with this specific fear, such as seeking professional help or using relaxation techniques. Therefore, while the response is largely aligned with the standards, it falls short in some areas, hence the score of 8.<\/rationale>"}
{"Reddit Post":"Did your anxiety get worse from therapy? I've been in therapy for almost two years. Regular twice per week visits. I thought that it would help me figure out why I struggle. \n\nTo sum it up, I've had more of a chaotic childhood than I've ever realized. The more I'd realize this during therapy, the worse my anxiety would get. \n\nDoes anyone relate? Maybe I'm doing this therapy thing all wrong???","Reddit ID":"Anxiety_30","Dimension":6,"Reappraisal":"Therapy experiences can vary greatly from person to person and really depend on whom you meet. Did you clearly communicate what you want and your objectives for this session? Is the therapist trying all sorts of different approaches that don’t match what you have asked for? It could be due to many factors, and there are several steps that you both should work out throughout the sessions. Some people try different therapists to find one who best suits their needs and expertise. It's important to reassess and refocus your attention on what you truly need from therapy. So, I say keep trying, but since it’s been two years and you don’t see any hope with your current therapist, maybe it’s time to search for a new one.","evaluation_raw_output_dim_1":"<score>8<\/score><rationale>The response does a good job of guiding the narrator to reassess their situation and consider whether their current therapy is worth their attention.

{"Reddit Post":"How 2 months of chronic stress has effected me physically I'm currently completing my A levels (a series of exam you do in the UK at the age of 17\/18, that determine whether you get into university)... as you can imagine, I have been stressed. I'm under a tremendous amount of pressure to get very high grades (straight A's). I've completed 2 exams, and have 5 left to go, 3 of which I'll be sitting tomorrow, the next day, and the day after that...\n\nI'm shocked at how this stress has effected me physically. I've always been fairly neurotic, but the anxiety I tend to feel is transient, and is rarely severe enough to manifest in anything physically significant, beyond a raised pulse and slight breathlessness.\n\nI knew I was getting myself *way* too worked up when I started to pull out hair in the shower. I have very thick hair, so a lot of it was coming out. I've had severe brain fog, which hasn't been the least bit helpful during a time when I have to be the most alert and *with it*'. I've had no appetite, and now my trousers are all loose, with one  pair literally falling down when I walk. The most bizarre symptom I've had is this weird jaw tension - my jaw is very clicky, and it feels incredibly tense and stiff. As a hypochondriac, I was convinced this was a heart attack, but I was reassured that it's probably just anxiety. I've had weird gastrointestinal symptoms, where I feel nauseous, and have this pit in my stomach all of the time, which could be caused by the lack of eating, but it persists even when I have eaten. \n\nAnd then of course feelings of impending doom, etc etc. \n\nI just can't wait for this to be over.","Reddit ID":"Anxiety_51","Dimension":1,"Reappraisal":"Please don’t underestimate the impact of psychological stress on your body and immune system.

{"Reddit Post":"Gaming rage (m, 21, has ADHD\/tourettes and aspergers) I get angry\/blow up, sometimes throw things (not expensive things like controllers or anything) or bang my desk when I play games and I lose consistently or do worse after better runs.

Maybe choose games that are less violent or stressful. You know what's triggering you: losing. So, perhaps play less stimulating or competitive games.
