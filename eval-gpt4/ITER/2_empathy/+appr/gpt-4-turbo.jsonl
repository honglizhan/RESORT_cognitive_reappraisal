I get extremely angry and violent when my mom does things that I've asked her not to do, sometimes it involves other people but mostly my mom since I'm around her the most.

I've asked her multiple times to let me know if she needs the machine when my clothes are still in there (since we tend to do our laundry at the same time for some reason) because I get irrationally mad when she touches my clothes. It doesn't happen too often since I usually take my clothes out and fold them before she even notices I did laundry, but I forget every once in a while and every time it makes my day a bit worse. I told her today that I don't care if it's 4am and I'm asleep, I want her to at least warn me that she's going to touch my clothes if I don't get up right away. \n\nI went back to my room after taking my clothes and I wanted to scream but I always manage to stop myself by just pretending to yell and by punching my mattress and pillows.

Your worth is not defined by others' opinions or behaviors, and reaching out for help is a courageous step towards a more positive path. It's okay to not be okay, and taking action to address these feelings is a proactive way to start regaining control. Additionally, recognizing that these feelings of anger and the impulse to lash out are not reflective of who you want to be is an important step in aligning your actions with your personal values. Acknowledging this discrepancy is a sign of self-awareness and the first step towards change.", "evaluation_raw_output_dim_23": "4"}

I have a bit of a problem and I'm not sure if this is correlated with a narcissistic perception due to ASD, but everyone who I encounter in my life that wrongs me or humiliates me, I write down their names and I keep these names stored with me for a very long time. I've been thinking about applying for a university course for computer programming and solely the reason why I am contemplating to take this course is because I have a grandiose fantasy where I'd track down the location of these individuals to allegedly kidnap them and take them to my garage where I'd tie them up to a chair, show in front of them on a projected screen their wrongdoing to me and deliberately starving them to death while playing Three Little Birds by Bob Marley on a radio next to them. This process would apply to anyone in my life that had carried out any perceived injustices against me, making me a notorious serial killer.\n\nI came to this subreddit just hours after posting on r/ontario a self-explanatory question I was humiliated for (which I deleted the post shortly thereafter) and had wrote down the usernames of all individuals involved that I perceived as hostile, it's been racing through my head all afternoon and I have been institutionalized twice for indulging in serial killer fantasies, but do not have a recorded history of violence and I grew up in a well family household without parental abuse. I consulted with my psychiatrist last month and he says it is typical to engage in homicidal fantasies when under the influence of medications and taking into account my cognitive diagnosis.\n\nWould anyone else be able to explain these homicidal ideations?", "Sub-Reddit": "r_anger", "Model": "gpt-4-turbo", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "It's important to recognize that thoughts and fantasies, while distressing, are not actions.

It's unlikely that others view you as negatively as you fear. Your anxiety seems to be significantly affecting your ability to cope with daily situations, and it might be amplifying these thoughts. Seeking support from a therapist could be very beneficial, as they can provide strategies to help you regain a sense of control over these feelings and improve your coping mechanisms. Remember, it's okay to step back and reassess the need for further action; often, the situation doesn't require as much attention as your anxiety suggests. Additionally, it might help to explore coping strategies that can provide immediate relief during stressful situations, such as deep breathing exercises or mindfulness techniques, to help you manage the physical symptoms you're experiencing and enhance your sense of control.", "evaluation_raw_output_dim_23": "4"}

I've done Klonopin and Xanan in the past and because it was incredibly addictive and I knew that the long-term damage in the brain would be irreversible I decided to quit.\\*\\*\n\nKlonopin gives me a mellow and sweet feeling, but in the next day I feel super depressed. And Xanax never did anything to me besides brutally kill my appetite.\n\nAmbien on the other hand... ignoring the part where we get crazy and do stuff that we will regret later, like texting an old crush and asking him on a date (yeah, I had the date... today, btw! oh well, it was fast)... so, what I was saying is that the good part of Ambien is that you feel some kind of freedom and a really peaceful state of mind.\n\nLSD gave me the closest to what I should feel to be the happiest... but only during the trip. But then there's a problem: you can never know what your next trip will be like. And from paradise I went to pure nightmare (ER and shit). So I don't feel like trying it again even microdosing - same goes for shrooms. And weed... yeah, it's pleasurable and shit, but I don't know how it would be if I use it in long term.\n\nI'm thinking more of a controlled substance for now, aimed for anxiety and is similar to what Ambien does. What do we have? I want to have my mind exactly like it is right now while I'm on Ambien: I feel that I can focus, study and the same time being super original e capable of relax whenever I can.

I have very thick hair, so a lot of it was coming out. I've had severe brain fog, which hasn't been the least bit helpful during a time when I have to be the most alert and *with it*'. I've had no appetite, and now my trousers are all loose, with one  pair literally falling down when I walk.

I've had extreme anxiety and panic attacks since I was in kindergarten. Nothing was ever \"easy\" for me and still is not. Sometimes I feel like in order to do anything I have to use all of my energy, whereas other people can do it and use almost no energy.\n\nI have tried many things to help my anxiety, but still it persists. I have been to counseling, which helped slightly, I am on anxiety medicine too since counseling did not help enough. Even with anxiety medicine, I still struggle with anxiety and because of it, depression. My anxiety medicine seems to have bad side effects, like no sex drive, super irregular periods, tiredness, night sweats. I would say it slightly helps but I also wonder sometimes if it is just a placebo affect in my mind.\n\n I struggle to work, be social or anything \"normal\" people do.

I've even excelled in school and just got my Associates degree. Now I am incredibly anxious because I need to get a job again now that I completed school but all I can think of is how anxious it makes me.

Fast forward and I'm now with my wife of 5 years. I'll have random episodes when I choke up and feel like gagging when I eat but I have NOTHING to be anxious about.

Consider setting small, achievable goals to build confidence and reduce avoidance behaviors, and give yourself credit for the efforts you're making to cope with your anxiety. This approach can help you gradually increase your perceived level of control over the situation, moving from a place of being overwhelmed to one where you can manage and direct your actions more effectively, in a way that aligns with your values.", "evaluation_raw_output_dim_23": "4"}

If you work for an employer they normally work out how much tax etc you owe and it's deducted at source so what you get in your pay check is yours. But if you're self employed you have to fill in a tax return each year. You can fill in the return from the 6th April and it has to be done by 31st January the following year. So the tax return I've just submitted is for tax year 2020-2021.\n\nI hate doing my tax return. My accounts are really simple, profits easy to calculate and very few expenses. But I'm so paranoid I'll do something wrong. There's so many different fields to fill in and I have no clue what half of them mean. I've always asked my sister to sit with me in the past when I do my returns but this year I did it all on my own.\n\nTo further complicate matters my accounts last year are screwed up because of coronavirus. My income was down ~75% but I was eligible for a government support scheme called the Self Employment Income Support Scheme. However I then had to declare all these figures on my tax returns which was even more boxes to tick.\n\nI also had to claim my fifth grant which means working out my turnover for the last two years etc. and freaking out that I'll somehow claim the wrong amount or screw something up.\n\nIt took me two weeks of staring at the folder to build up the courage and then about half an hour ago I finally hit that sweet spot of the anxiety of not doing it outweighing the anxiety of doing it (the grant deadline is September).

As a result, many people are fearing that COVID-19 restrictions will be constantly looming over us for the rest of human history, persistently drifting in and out of our lives. I'd like to explain why these fears simply are not rational. Despite what some say, Israel has not achieved herd immunity. They are very close, of course, but they are not at that milestone *yet.* About 5,160,000 Israelis are fully vaccinated, equivalent to roughly 56% of the Israeli population is fully vaccinated. Add that to all the Israelis who have attained natural immunity from the virus, and the percentage rate of immunity within Israel arrives at roughly 66%. For a group to have herd immunity to COVID-19, 70% must be immune. Because Israel has yet to achieve herd immunity, it is still possible for an outbreak to take place. Even with this in mind, the outbreak Israel has been facing is minuscule compared to the size of outbreaks at any point in 2020.

{"Reddit ID": "o7y52c", "Reddit Post": "The following has been my experience: Started showing Covid symptoms at the beginning of May 2021. They lasted about two and a half weeks. After the third and a half week or so, I felt well enough to put in a full workout. I did so, and 48 hours later, my Covid symptoms had returned in pretty much full force. I've read about different forms \"long Covid\" takes - it's not always persistent - some report reinfection or reactivation of Covid after periods of dormancy. Two weeks after my initial reactivation, my symptoms begin to subside. I decide to get the first Covid vaccine (I read that in some \"vaccine vanguard\" countries like Israel, they were recommending one covid shot for those who had already had the virus). I get the first shot, and feel a little not great for about 48 hours or so (mild discomfort in lymph nodes, some fatigue, weakness), but afterwards I begin to feel great, better than I had at any point since before I got Covid in early May. A week ago I put in a full exercise. About 24 hours later, I don't feel like I felt when I had Covid, but I definitely feel the exact same as I did *after* I had gotten my first shot - mild discomfort in lymph nodes, some weakness. I am under the impression working out a second time \"reactivated\" dormant Covid, but the vaccine kicked back in and enlisted my immune system in fighting this second activation. Finding information about the virus at this time has been so frustrating - official counsel has lagged internet anecdotes and similar by a considerable amount of time.

As of right now we have not been seeing many case increases here in the US. The occasional rise, but so far it hasn't been huge. That's why I feel I should take time off from looking at the updates of teh Delta Variant. The fact that we are still making progress with vaccination should remind myself that we are still on the path to beating the pandemic and that these restrictions are soon going to be gone. THAT'S the motivation I should have. Yes, we still have to be vigilant and yes, we DO have more to vaccinate, but things are just so much better now than before.

{"Reddit ID": "o93rqd", "Reddit Post": "Hey, everyone, just in a particularly dark patch, and feeling the need for some dialogue. I've been doing a lot of thinking, lately, and I think I've finally got a handle on why the pandemic has been so chronically stressful for me, and others, over the past year. Specifically those in first world countries, in relation to how it affects us on a psychological level. As people, we tend to experience bad things as happening suddenly, all at once, and then you deal with them. A broken leg, a car wreak, getting fired, getting dumped, etc. Deeply unpleasant, but relatively short-duration things. These are type-1 and type-2 problems; Things which can be avoided, or which can be fixed. But the Coronavirus has loaded us all down with the third type of problem. The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part. Lots of us weren't doing too great before the pandemic hit, but then, after 15 months of slow, grinding lockdowns, endless bad news on top of bad news, and nowhere to go to get away from it...

I (22f) got my first shot of Biontech last week and so did my sister. My mom is fully vaccinated with Moderna. My stepdad received his first shot of Biontech two days ago. But we also have two kids (age 5 and 3) in our family. Obviously they can't get vaccinated. Hearing that Delta is very transmissible, and often even infects vaccinated folk, scares me. I know efficiency of the vaccines was never 100% but I believed at least we'd be safe from Covid when we get vaccinated. I work full-time and go to school. At school, everyone wears a mask, we are 1,5m apart, the windows are open and everyone gets tested daily. At work, my coworker wears a mask and so do I. When I eat or drink I go outside. Otherwise, I don't take off my mask at all (I wear FFP2 or FFP3). My boss doesn't wear a mask but he only occasionally comes into our office. Also, everyone at my work place had Corona three months ago except me. They caught Alpha (B117). I also have to take public transit. Everyone wears masks. Windows are open.

I have been getting regularly tested since March 21 (1 to 4 times a week) and it came back negative all the time, even when we had a high national incidence and infection was more likely.

FWIW, I also live thousands of miles from all of my family. My anxiety got pretty bad several months ago during the holidays when Covid was at its peak and was impossible to see people. I was also still furloughed from work and had a lot of time to think (and overthink). Ive dealt with mild anxiety in the past but nothing like this. During that time it got so bad that I drove thousands of miles to be with relatives. I was able to spend time with them in the evenings which was really helpful and eventually I felt back to normal for the most part. Since then Ive also gotten my job back. However, during the last month Ive gone through a breakup of sorts and that has brought my anxiety back. I lived alone for several years before this and it used to be awesome for me but now it just feels painful. Im almost afraid of being alone. My anxiety is always bad in the mornings; I dont get a lot of sleep because of it which makes it difficult to focus at work. Also, my anxiety gives me get bad stomach aches and I lose my appetite so it makes it really hard to eat. I usually have to force myself to eat every day which just isnt fun. My work is partially opened up and Ive been trying to go in at least a few hours a day just to be around other humans. That helps for sure. Ive been trying to take early morning bike rides as soon as I get up and that typically helps but in the few hours before work starts, Im still rather anxious. Ive tried meditating (which kinda makes things worse), journaling, watching mindless TV, reaching out to friends, etc. I talk to a therapist on a weekly basis which has been helpful. I tried antidepressants (SSRIs) for about 6 months or so and they made my anxiety worse at first and I didnt feel like they were super helpful after that.

{"Reddit ID": "og9qaf", "Reddit Post": "Hi everyone - thank you for the support shown in this forum. Since March 2020, I've been in a COVID bubble with my wife, sister-in-law, and their parents. While the last year and a half have been trying emotionally and professionally for all of us, things are looking up with the vaccine. However, my wife's parents refuse to get vaccinated. They are not in great health and my father-in-law specifically is older and I worry about his health. Therefore, even as things have started to open up, my family has been relatively more conservative, with no masks-free indoor interaction outside of the family, even with people that are vaccinated, for fear of spreading the virus to my inlaws. This is becoming a big problem because I am building a startup and my cofounder is someone I met during the pandemic. He and I need to start building a more regular working cadence and relationship, but this is really difficult since my wife and SIL are not comfortable with me working in person with him, even though he is vaccinated (though he is much less careful than us). For my part, I would like to push the company forward, and agree that our creative work would improve if we were able to work in-person a couple of times per week.

From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to. I feel like I've become so negative that I don't want to share my thoughts with people because I will bring them down, and I already feel like I pushed some people away by doing this. I emailed multiple psychiatrists, but only one answered me and had one short appointment, and told me I should continue looking because he doesn't have time for new patients. I spend most of my time trying to get the motivation to work but failing, and looking at vaccination percentages and restrictions around the world hoping to see them improve and thinking about where else can be better than here.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_covid19_support", "Model": "gpt-4-turbo", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "It's important to recognize that the situation you're experiencing is the result of a complex interplay of global health challenges and not a consequence of your personal actions.

This could be done in the context of each kid telling something unique about them self. My son is very open Aspergers, and would have no problem doing that. \n\nPeople on the \"against\" side, have concerns that it would be singling him out and may cause more problems and teasing.\n\nPeople on the \"for\" side point out that the kids will pick up fairly quickly that my son is \"different\" and being up-front about what that difference is and how they could help could prevent problems. Also, they point out that if a child had a physical disability you would certainly talk about it, e.g.  \"Billy has a XXX so he would be able to go swimming with us, but he loves to sit on deck and you can still play ball with him that way\".\n\nSo what do you think?", "Sub-Reddit": "r_parenting", "Model": "gpt-4-turbo", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "Considering the situation from a different perspective, it's important to recognize that the decision to inform others about your son's Asperger's is not about assigning responsibility but rather about creating an inclusive and understanding environment for him.

Does it interfere with your work and life too much? Is it possible to do both 1/2 public and 1/2 home somehow?\n\nEdit: I guess I should clarify- I no way intend to keep my daughter out of social activities, I would most likely have her attend a home-schooling co-op should my decision sway this way. I would also have tutors come over and help her in the areas I have trouble with (math...) so that she doesn't struggle her way through college or group projects. Also, I know how home-schooling can be abused (and why that is one reason it is controversial), my partner and I are both very open minded, free-thinking people who love to explore all realms of ideologies and theories (in other words we aren't going to shove her in Jesus camp and tell her that everyone is evil and wrong except us), also I would have her attend summer camps or maybe join a club so that she would get plenty of social interaction not to mention give us both a brief break from one another (kids need space too!). \n\nI just want her to have a better experience than I did in public schools. I wish I'd learned what I know now back then (I guess we all do) but the classes I was offered were mostly test-prep and my teachers were very, how you say, \"Do what I say, don't ask questions, shut up sit down\" etc...\n\nWe can't afford private school, but there are other school systems I'm looking into, and I have years to decide, I just want to be informed is all. \n\nThanks for everyone's input, I greatly appreciate it!", "Sub-Reddit": "r_parenting", "Model": "gpt-4-turbo", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "<reappraisal>[Exploring various educational options shows proactive parenting.

She has no other issues and is just being kept warm and fed through an iv in the umbilical cord and today started with what we could get from mommy being fed through a tube in her nose. My problem though is, I am terrified, I held her for about 30 mins while she was swaddled up and between the tears of happiness I was terrified. I am so scared of startling her and all the tubes and wires, I would like to do the skin to skin contact, but I am so afraid of damaging her, and all of the wires really really scare me.

People watched as if they pitied me while I struggled to stack the carseat on the suitcase while holding a sqwirmy baby.\n\nI blew off the looks and masterfuly maneuvered baby and luggage to the cart check-out (which don't have baby seats in them) to check one out and make the tow to the parking garage easier.

No one, not even security would help. \n\nI eventually gave up on the cart and tried to navigate my luggage while wrestling my Christmas ham to sit still and hang on to my neck en route to the garage. Halfway across a street the carseat falls off the suitcase. Again, looks of pity but no offer to help!

This past year has been upsetting to her, though.\n\nUp until about a year ago she spent her days with her grandparents. Then they left the country for a while, and she started daycare, which she enjoyed... she had no issues being away from us all day. Her grandparents came back in February, and at the same time, her little brother was born. She went back to staying with the grandparents during the day for the whole spring; then in the summer, grandparents had to leave again. During the summer she started to throw tantrums, especially around eating, but we took it in stride, dealt with it, and things got better. She doesn't do that anymore, though like a lot of kids she just doesn't like to eat much. But she gets enough nutrition.\n\nHer grandparents (who live with us) have been back again since September, and ever since, she panics whenever grandma leaves the room, unless it's just part of her routine. Routine separations are no issue; she's all smiles when mom and I leave for work in the mornings, she goes to bed without fussing. But if someone has to step out unexpectedly, she breaks down.\n\nLast night grandma had to run an errand. In the midst of crying, my daughter sprinted across the room and tripped, of course prompting sympathy from grandma. But something seemed off - there was nothing to trip on where she fell - so in my most gentle and sympathetic voice, after she calmed down, I asked her about it. She volunteered that she fell over on purpose.\n\nEvery time, within minutes of someone leaving, she's fine again, and showing no outward signs of stress.

The teacher sits at her desk basically all day while the kids do worksheets that are overly simplistic even for their young age.  Friday, she sent home progress reports.  The scores just didn't really fit my son's strengths and weaknesses.  A friend that also has a child in the class and I compared notes and the scores for both children were exactly the same-all 19 of them.  So, I'm guessing she just filled this evaluation the same for each student.  What do you think I should do about it?
