Even after the event has happened, and been wrapped up, I still can't shake the anger caused by the situation for a few days. \n\nI am wondering if there are people who have similar issues, and what ways you have found to let go of the residual anger/cope? \n\nIt seems so absurd intellectually to still hold onto things, but I still can't shake it. \n\nFor context, my biggest trigger in the world is Dog urine or feces in my house. My boyfriend absolutely loves dogs and got a Beagle about 6 mos. ago. I on the other hand could do without ever seeing a dog again, but I put up with them. My one condition was that she be potty trained. She is potty trained, however, she is scared of literally EVERYTHING and also doesn't like me, so when he is gone she gets anxious and any loud noise or sudden movement has her peeing, trembling, whining, teeth chattering, the whole nine yards. She has even peed on my pillow in my bed before. It sends me through the roof, so much so that I need to leave so that I do not become violent. The thing that sucks is that other than her noise phobia, peeing, and separation anxiety from my bf, she is a very sweet and well trained dog. Her and I just do not get along, especially when she pees out of fear. \nBUT I hold onto the anger of wanting to just beat the hell out of her for days.

I am an adult, I should be past those embarrassing child-like behaviours. Besides, at my age i'm pretty sure this classifies as domestic violence.\nThroughout my life I had those minor outbursts of violence, where i bit people, kicked them etc. then in effort of stopping it, i turned to myself and whenever anger got too overwhelming i would hit myself on the head but that just made me look like i'm unhinged and crazy, so not ideal either. I stopped both of those behaviours 2-3 years ago and I just pinpointed it to teenage hormones/rebellion. i was so sure i got a hold of my violent outbursts, put them past me. i was doing so well, those outbursts were no longer a thing, whenever i was about to throw a rage fit i managed to cool down. but today it came back all over again.\nnow i am seriously afraid I might hurt someone in the future out of anger. or even k*ll them. i'm legit afraid of myself. cause in the moment when i am angry, sometimes i experience such blinding rage that i seemingly can't stop myself.  i am so afraid that in the future i will hurt my potential boyfriend, friends, family. if this never stops, maybe someday i'll go to jail for abuse. i don't want that. i don't wanna be a bad person. i want to get better. \n\ni also feel very sorry and i wanna apologize to my mom. the deal is... she'll forgive me, of course she will, but i don't want to issue an empty apology without showing improvement first. words without improvement are worth nothing.\n\nany good techniques that will help me calm nerves in a heated moment fairly easily? i wanna be a good daughter so bad :(", "Sub-Reddit": "r_anger", "Model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "The narrator takes responsibility for their actions and acknowledges that they are the one who bit their mother.

So lo and behold, i check my mailbox and see a \"sorry we missed you\" notice. I was home ALL DAY and the package was an amazon package which does not require a signature and they refused to deliver it to my door.\n\nI had to go to the post office to pick it up. When I get there I tell the lady and ask why I'm here essentially why can't they just deliver to my fucking door. She says that it'd take the workers too long to do that because our complex gets so many packages. I'm soo annoyed. I feel inconvenienced because of the drive there and how absolutely unnecessary this is. It's like the residents are being punished because we order packages. Ridiculous.

I have a bit of a problem and I'm not sure if this is correlated with a narcissistic perception due to ASD, but everyone who I encounter in my life that wrongs me or humiliates me, I write down their names and I keep these names stored with me for a very long time. I've been thinking about applying for a university course for computer programming and solely the reason why I am contemplating to take this course is because I have a grandiose fantasy where I'd track down the location of these individuals to allegedly kidnap them and take them to my garage where I'd tie them up to a chair, show in front of them on a projected screen their wrongdoing to me and deliberately starving them to death while playing Three Little Birds by Bob Marley on a radio next to them. This process would apply to anyone in my life that had carried out any perceived injustices against me, making me a notorious serial killer.\n\nI came to this subreddit just hours after posting on r/ontario a self-explanatory question I was humiliated for (which I deleted the post shortly thereafter) and had wrote down the usernames of all individuals involved that I perceived as hostile, it's been racing through my head all afternoon and I have been institutionalized twice for indulging in serial killer fantasies, but do not have a recorded history of violence and I grew up in a well family household without parental abuse.

This has not only caused me and my family hundreds of dollars of damages, but I also usually get hurt in the process. Sure, wounds can heal, but having them in the first place because of a mental breakdown because my pen has dried out is a pretty fucked up thing in my book. \n\nI tried putting said things down before starting to hit something, but I just have zero self control and can't consistently do so. I also tried calming myself down by just staying still and doing nothing, but that usually gets me even more angry and I cause more harm to myself. I tried hitting other things like my pillows, but that causes almost the same effect as staying still. And after I break something I get sober and realize what I just did and get a bad feeling of doom or whatever that is.\n\nIs there any way I can at the very least minimize these breakouts?

The job itself isn't bad, i find myself liking talking to customers and my co workers are really nice, but i feel really underprepared in terms of training, obviously since it's my second day, but they already had me on the bar and in the drive through and i feel as though if this is how quickly they expect me to be able to work efficiently with the rest of the team then i am fked .

The narrator also mentions that they have been diagnosed with severe anxiety, and this situation is exacerbating their symptoms.

However, the narrator does not explicitly state that they need to attend to the situation further, so I have rated their level of need as 7 out of 9.\n\nIt's understandable that you may feel responsible for your own discomfort in this situation, but it's important to remember that you are not responsible for the layout of the classroom.

If you work for an employer they normally work out how much tax etc you owe and it's deducted at source so what you get in your pay check is yours. But if you're self employed you have to fill in a tax return each year. You can fill in the return from the 6th April and it has to be done by 31st January the following year. So the tax return I've just submitted is for tax year 2020-2021.\n\nI hate doing my tax return. My accounts are really simple, profits easy to calculate and very few expenses. But I'm so paranoid I'll do something wrong. There's so many different fields to fill in and I have no clue what half of them mean. I've always asked my sister to sit with me in the past when I do my returns but this year I did it all on my own.\n\nTo further complicate matters my accounts last year are screwed up because of coronavirus. My income was down ~75% but I was eligible for a government support scheme called the Self Employment Income Support Scheme. However I then had to declare all these figures on my tax returns which was even more boxes to tick.\n\nI also had to claim my fifth grant which means working out my turnover for the last two years etc. and freaking out that I'll somehow claim the wrong amount or screw something up.\n\nIt took me two weeks of staring at the folder to build up the courage and then about half an hour ago I finally hit that sweet spot of the anxiety of not doing it outweighing the anxiety of doing it (the grant deadline is September).

I lost my uncle who is my best friend, we lived abroad all our lives but because of the pandemic I returned home, and barely managed to see him those 2 years. He was the kindest and purest human being. I met him briefly yesterday as we took him to the hospital. Today he passed away from COVID, he was deathly afraid from needles and the vaccination. I feel so so powerless. So guilty I didnt reply to his phone call 3 days earlier as my family was also sick of Covid and I was caring for them. The death feels like it could have been avoided, he took the remaining precautions but it didnt work. At least he died happy alongside his family in his hometown where I live. I dont know what or how to live life without him in my mind, without meeting him ever again, with seeing the same places without him. Im tired, I want to cry. We both hated living at home now I am stuck living on earth without him, I feel this home is the right place for me - was waiting eagerly for him to return. But he barely lasted a week before his death. But mentally I am exhausted of living here, of the pandemic, of having my friends all abroad and getting out of contact, of being alone to face his death. To face this life.

As a result, many people are fearing that COVID-19 restrictions will be constantly looming over us for the rest of human history, persistently drifting in and out of our lives. I'd like to explain why these fears simply are not rational. Despite what some say, Israel has not achieved herd immunity. They are very close, of course, but they are not at that milestone *yet.* About 5,160,000 Israelis are fully vaccinated, equivalent to roughly 56% of the Israeli population is fully vaccinated. Add that to all the Israelis who have attained natural immunity from the virus, and the percentage rate of immunity within Israel arrives at roughly 66%. For a group to have herd immunity to COVID-19, 70% must be immune. Because Israel has yet to achieve herd immunity, it is still possible for an outbreak to take place. Even with this in mind, the outbreak Israel has been facing is minuscule compared to the size of outbreaks at any point in 2020.

{"Reddit ID": "o93rqd", "Reddit Post": "Hey, everyone, just in a particularly dark patch, and feeling the need for some dialogue. I've been doing a lot of thinking, lately, and I think I've finally got a handle on why the pandemic has been so chronically stressful for me, and others, over the past year. Specifically those in first world countries, in relation to how it affects us on a psychological level. As people, we tend to experience bad things as happening suddenly, all at once, and then you deal with them. A broken leg, a car wreak, getting fired, getting dumped, etc. Deeply unpleasant, but relatively short-duration things. These are type-1 and type-2 problems; Things which can be avoided, or which can be fixed. But the Coronavirus has loaded us all down with the third type of problem. The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part. Lots of us weren't doing too great before the pandemic hit, but then, after 15 months of slow, grinding lockdowns, endless bad news on top of bad news, and nowhere to go to get away from it... Is it really a wonder why everyone is so unhappy all the time? I feel like a machine that's trying harder and harder to run without lubricant, to the point that it's just scraping metal-on-metal, and every day is a bit harder than the last. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to keep this up. The possibility of a variant wave in the Fall, forcing us back into yet another lockdown, terrifies me. I can't relax, I can't focus, and it's been seven or eight months since I've had any meaningful hope for the future. This late in the game, I just... can't shake the feeling that things will never get better. 2019 was the best things will ever be in my lifetime, and it's all downhill from here.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_covid19_support", "Model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "It's understandable that the narrator is feeling overwhelmed and stressed by the pandemic. However, it's important to remember that not everything is within our control. While it's natural to feel a sense of responsibility for our own well-being and the well-being of those around us, it's important to recognize that we can only control what we can control.\n\nOne way to reappraise the situation is to focus on the things that are within our control. For example, we can control our own thoughts and emotions, and we can take steps to take care of our physical and mental health. We can also control how we react to the things that are outside of our control, such as the pandemic. Instead of feeling overwhelmed and stressed, we can try to find ways to cope with the situation, such as practicing mindfulness or seeking support from friends and family.\n\nIt's also important to remember that the pandemic is a global issue, and we are all in this together. While we may not be able to control the pandemic itself, we can control how we respond to it and how we support those around us. By focusing on the things that are within our control and finding ways to cope with the things that are outside of our control, we can reappraise the situation and find a sense of peace and hope.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to recognize that not everything is within our control, and it's okay to not feel responsible for everything. It's important to take care of ourselves and not put too much pressure on ourselves to control things that we can't.

I (22f) got my first shot of Biontech last week and so did my sister. My mom is fully vaccinated with Moderna. My stepdad received his first shot of Biontech two days ago. But we also have two kids (age 5 and 3) in our family. Obviously they can't get vaccinated. Hearing that Delta is very transmissible, and often even infects vaccinated folk, scares me. I know efficiency of the vaccines was never 100% but I believed at least we'd be safe from Covid when we get vaccinated. I work full-time and go to school. At school, everyone wears a mask, we are 1,5m apart, the windows are open and everyone gets tested daily. At work, my coworker wears a mask and so do I. When I eat or drink I go outside. Otherwise, I don't take off my mask at all (I wear FFP2 or FFP3). My boss doesn't wear a mask but he only occasionally comes into our office. Also, everyone at my work place had Corona three months ago except me. They caught Alpha (B117). I also have to take public transit. Everyone wears masks. Windows are open. How big is my risk of infection? I have been getting regularly tested since March 21 (1 to 4 times a week) and it came back negative all the time, even when we had a high national incidence and infection was more likely. National incidence is now 5 cases per 100.000 people. In my town it is 3 cases per 100.000 people. At the moment, we have 49 active cases (my town is huge; 500.000 people live here). Do I really have to be worried? I even wear my ffp2 mask when I walk my dog. When I am fully vaccinated, what safety measures should I still follow?

{"Reddit ID": "od9j5d", "Reddit Post": "Does anyone have any advice on best ways to deal with pretty bad anxiety while living alone and working from home? FWIW, I also live thousands of miles from all of my family. My anxiety got pretty bad several months ago during the holidays when Covid was at its peak and was impossible to see people. I was also still furloughed from work and had a lot of time to think (and overthink). Ive dealt with mild anxiety in the past but nothing like this. During that time it got so bad that I drove thousands of miles to be with relatives. I was able to spend time with them in the evenings which was really helpful and eventually I felt back to normal for the most part. Since then Ive also gotten my job back. However, during the last month Ive gone through a breakup of sorts and that has brought my anxiety back. I lived alone for several years before this and it used to be awesome for me but now it just feels painful. Im almost afraid of being alone. My anxiety is always bad in the mornings; I dont get a lot of sleep because of it which makes it difficult to focus at work. Also, my anxiety gives me get bad stomach aches and I lose my appetite so it makes it really hard to eat. I usually have to force myself to eat every day which just isnt fun. My work is partially opened up and Ive been trying to go in at least a few hours a day just to be around other humans. That helps for sure. Ive been trying to take early morning bike rides as soon as I get up and that typically helps but in the few hours before work starts, Im still rather anxious. Ive tried meditating (which kinda makes things worse), journaling, watching mindless TV, reaching out to friends, etc. I talk to a therapist on a weekly basis which has been helpful. I tried antidepressants (SSRIs) for about 6 months or so and they made my anxiety worse at first and I didnt feel like they were super helpful after that.

It is planned to be a garden party but forecast says rain, so it's probably indoors. It's in my hometown, so I would need to travel there a few hours to attend. I haven't seen many of the people attending there since last year including some of my friends. Mainly because I didn't want to meet because of the virus. I only texted with them. Cases are very low (sometimes zero) there. Some people there are fully vaccinated, some got their 1st shot and some haven't yet. I got my first shot 3 weeks ago(Moderna). I haven't met such a big group since last summer. Only smaller groups and always outdoors. You can probably tell by now that I'm a very careful person when it comes to dealing with the virus. I always followed my principles. Right know I'm going back and fourth whether I should go or not. Is it still okay to apply the precautionary principle here and not attend? I mean I'm 3 weeks out from being fully vaccinated. Everyone else there is in a spirit to party because we couldn't for so long. I'm not having that feeling. Quite the opposite.

I'm struggling so much at the moment with having any sort of hope for the future. It just feels like we will never get normality back. COVID has completely ruined me. I went from being a (mostly) happy and functional human to depressed and suicidal since 2020. I take anti depressants now and I started therapy but even on my good days, I still feel like there's this dark cloud over my head and I'm waiting for the next shitstorm. I live in the UK and we've had three long lockdowns. Everything was looking pretty hopeful a few months ago, but since the last lockdown rules started easing, cases and hospitalisations have started rising again, even though we're doing pretty well with vaccinations. Our Government have handled the pandemic pretty poorly throughout and managed to let the Delta variant in with their loose border control measures. It just feels like this never ending cycle of rising cases, lockdown, falling cases, lift lockdown, rising cases again, etc etc and I'm terrified of going into another lockdown in the Autumn. I can't do it again. We keep saying the lockdowns are to protect our (underfunded) NHS from being overwhelmed but if hospitalisations are already getting too high now in the SUMMER, how the hell will they cope with a Winter wave with not only COVID cases but also a new wave of Flu cases which have been low the last year because of the lockdowns??? I feel guilty for complaining as I know other people have it much worse, and having already had the virus, it's not affected me all that badly. But the restrictions have meant I can no longer do my job (musician), I can't meet a partner, I've lost all hope for the future and I just feel like I'm waiting for the next bit of bad news. If the vaccines aren't enough for getting us out of this shit, what will be???? I just don't feel like life is worth living anymore under these restrictions.

While the last year and a half have been trying emotionally and professionally for all of us, things are looking up with the vaccine. However, my wife's parents refuse to get vaccinated. They are not in great health and my father-in-law specifically is older and I worry about his health. Therefore, even as things have started to open up, my family has been relatively more conservative, with no masks-free indoor interaction outside of the family, even with people that are vaccinated, for fear of spreading the virus to my inlaws. This is becoming a big problem because I am building a startup and my cofounder is someone I met during the pandemic. He and I need to start building a more regular working cadence and relationship, but this is really difficult since my wife and SIL are not comfortable with me working in person with him, even though he is vaccinated (though he is much less careful than us). For my part, I would like to push the company forward, and agree that our creative work would improve if we were able to work in-person a couple of times per week. I'm just at a loss - my wife is grieving what she perceives as the loss of her parents' sanity and doesn't want to cut them off, but I face real professional challenges (let alone the ongoing personal and mental health challenges) from continuing the status quo.

{"Reddit ID": "oga1in", "Reddit Post": "This lockdown has gone on forever. From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all.

Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to. I feel like I've become so negative that I don't want to share my thoughts with people because I will bring them down, and I already feel like I pushed some people away by doing this.

I wish I'd learned what I know now back then (I guess we all do) but the classes I was offered were mostly test-prep and my teachers were very, how you say, \"Do what I say, don't ask questions, shut up sit down\" etc...\n\nWe can't afford private school, but there are other school systems I'm looking into, and I have years to decide, I just want to be informed is all. \n\nThanks for everyone's input, I greatly appreciate it!", "Sub-Reddit": "r_parenting", "Model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "Based on the analysis above, it seems that the narrator takes some responsibility for their decision to home-school their daughter, but also recognizes that they are taking steps to ensure their daughter has a well-rounded education and experiences.

I know its all relative and there are folks out there who cant get pregnant at all, and others who have had more miscarriages... everything is relative, but you know that doesn't dimishing how we are both feeling right now. my wife is devastated and it's sort hard for me to see her this way.  I wish there was something we could do, that anyone could do- no one tells you man that trying to have a baby can be sooo hard, so painful.  anyway, thats all.

She's 8 months old and as cute as can be.  The thing is - we get a LOT of attention when we go out with her.  Is this normal?  She's our first, and I was in no way prepared for the number of people who would stop us, want to see her, want to take pictures of her, want to ooohh and ahhh over her all the time.  \n\nI'm sure as she gets a little older, this will decrease.

This past year has been upsetting to her, though.\n\nUp until about a year ago she spent her days with her grandparents. Then they left the country for a while, and she started daycare, which she enjoyed... she had no issues being away from us all day. Her grandparents came back in February, and at the same time, her little brother was born. She went back to staying with the grandparents during the day for the whole spring; then in the summer, grandparents had to leave again. During the summer she started to throw tantrums, especially around eating, but we took it in stride, dealt with it, and things got better. She doesn't do that anymore, though like a lot of kids she just doesn't like to eat much. But she gets enough nutrition.\n\nHer grandparents (who live with us) have been back again since September, and ever since, she panics whenever grandma leaves the room, unless it's just part of her routine. Routine separations are no issue; she's all smiles when mom and I leave for work in the mornings, she goes to bed without fussing. But if someone has to step out unexpectedly, she breaks down.\n\nLast night grandma had to run an errand. In the midst of crying, my daughter sprinted across the room and tripped, of course prompting sympathy from grandma. But something seemed off - there was nothing to trip on where she fell - so in my most gentle and sympathetic voice, after she calmed down, I asked her about it. She volunteered that she fell over on purpose.\n\nEvery time, within minutes of someone leaving, she's fine again, and showing no outward signs of stress.
