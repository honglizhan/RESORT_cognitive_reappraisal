She has even peed on my pillow in my bed before. It sends me through the roof, so much so that I need to leave so that I do not become violent.

I'm 29 and it still causes me problems.\n\nI know I have problems - I've always known I had problems. I'm pretty open and honest about it. At school the only advice I got was being told to hold my breath and count up to 10, well that and being told if I didn't grow up then I was going to go to prison.\n\nI have tried a lot of times - and with a lot of money - to manage my anger issues, but to be honest the feedback I've got from a few different counsellors and psychotherapists has been along the lines of \"well - everybody gets really angry sometimes\", \"you have Aspergers so it's quite normal\", \"you find yourself in a lot of situations at work and in your personal life that anybody would find stressful\".\n\nI've tried to DIY it with meditation and mindfulness, I know I need a 15 minute window to cool down after getting mad, I have tried antidepressants. Sometimes it seems like despite all of that, I just end up seeing red and ruining things.\n\nI think I am pretty clear *why* I get mad - in retrospect can rationalise it and go through what about a situation really frustrates me.\n\nI have an 18 month son and I can't stand to see him watch me get mad - I don't want to let anybody - especially him down with my temper.

I believed it was because I'm ugly but I don't want to think that so I'm trying to erase that. People have told me in attractive but I remain skeptical at times. I haven't had a date in about 8 months and have barely gotten any likes or matches on eharmony, tinder, and bumble. I'm on 3 dating apps and I can't even get a girls number you read that right. I just don't know why I'm so disconnected from the dating scene. I cant blame it on girls losing interest because that's not the case at all. I never even get any interest to even get a response that's not a rejection. I don't know what it is. I'm not a total turn off, I'm funny, I'm fairly intelligent, I make good money, I'm fun to be around, I'm a vet and I have good taste in clothing.

It sounds like you're feeling frustrated and uncertain about your dating life, and you're looking for some perspective on why you're not getting the results you want.\n\nFirst, it's important to remember that dating can be a challenging and unpredictable process, and it's not uncommon for it to take time to find the right person. It's also important to remember that your worth and attractiveness are not defined by your dating life or your physical appearance. You have many positive qualities that make you a great catch, such as your sense of humor, intelligence, and kindness.\n\nOne possibility is that your expectations may be a bit too high, and you're putting too much pressure on yourself to find the perfect match right away. It might be helpful to lower your expectations and focus on enjoying the process of getting to know different people and seeing where things go.\n\nAdditionally, it might be helpful to try some new things and step out of your comfort zone. For example, you could try joining a new social club or group that aligns with your interests, volunteering for a cause you care about, or taking a class or workshop to learn a new skill. This can help you meet new people and build your confidence in social situations.\n\nRemember that dating is a learning experience, and it's okay to make mistakes and experience setbacks along the way.

She says that it'd take the workers too long to do that because our complex gets so many packages. I'm soo annoyed.

I get extremely angry and violent when my mom does things that I've asked her not to do, sometimes it involves other people but mostly my mom since I'm around her the most.

Even though I don't let her see my anger and I don't yell at her (since she can out-yell me and would probably send me to my dad's forever), I feel terrible for feeling this way toward the person that took care of me my entire life.\n\nThis morning, she was drying her clothes after I had just done laundry, so she took my clothes out of the dryer and put them into a hamper thing. I've asked her multiple times to let me know if she needs the machine when my clothes are still in there (since we tend to do our laundry at the same time for some reason) because I get irrationally mad when she touches my clothes. It doesn't happen too often since I usually take my clothes out and fold them before she even notices I did laundry, but I forget every once in a while and every time it makes my day a bit worse. I told her today that I don't care if it's 4am and I'm asleep, I want her to at least warn me that she's going to touch my clothes if I don't get up right away. \n\nI went back to my room after taking my clothes and I wanted to scream but I always manage to stop myself by just pretending to yell and by punching my mattress and pillows.

While it's understandable that your parents have been advised to manage his behavior through self-regulation, there are other options that may be able to help your brother.\n\nFirstly, it's important to note that hemiplegia does not necessarily mean that your brother will have anger problems or difficulty controlling his behavior. However, the damage to his brain may have affected his ability to regulate his emotions and impulse control.\n\nHere are some potential options that may be able to help your brother:\n\n1. Neuropsychological assessment: A comprehensive assessment by a neuropsychologist can help identify the specific cognitive and behavioral challenges your brother is facing, and inform the development of an appropriate treatment plan.\n2. Behavioral therapy: A therapist trained in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) may be able to help your brother learn skills to manage his anger and aggression.\n3. Medication: In some cases, medication may be prescribed to help regulate mood and impulse control. However, this should be done under the close supervision of a qualified medical professional.\n4.

The job itself isn't bad, i find myself liking talking to customers and my co workers are really nice, but i feel really underprepared in terms of training, obviously since it's my second day, but they already had me on the bar and in the drive through and i feel as though if this is how quickly they expect me to be able to work efficiently with the rest of the team then i am fked . I haven't really been able to eat since i started and i barely sleep anymore because i am so anxious and constantly dreading the next shift, and the rest of the week because i only have two days off. This has honestly put me in a very bad place where I just want to find a way to escape it all but I feel as though quitting would make me really disappointed in myself for giving up. But, I dont think i'm able to take care of myself properly while i'm so anxious. I am crying at night when i get home and in the morning before shifts and i'm not even able to do anything else but stress out until I go in. I know this isn't a starbucks issue it's more personal, but i've worked as a barista before in a small local coffee shop and i was completely comfortable after only a few shifts. I don't know what steps to take to help myself right now and I was wondering if the job is really worth all the stress and anxiety. i try many coping techniques like breathing and the 333, and journaling and talking it out or just crying to expel whatever i need to, but it's like a never ending cycle help.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_anxiety", "Model": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of stress and anxiety in your new job at Starbucks.

Even with anxiety medicine, I still struggle with anxiety and because of it, depression.

I would say it slightly helps but I also wonder sometimes if it is just a placebo affect in my mind.\n\n I struggle to work, be social or anything \"normal\" people do. The longest I have had a job was 7 months straight before I quit and changed jobs. I am a hard worker when my anxiety doesn't get the best of me and I have excelled in any job I have done.

I honestly only feel this way when we are going out to eat with her family. Or with some of my family that I don't see often. But I love her family. We have lived together and always been around each other since we started dating . So why I'm the hell do I still get anxiety when they call us and ask us to dinner or to come over? Sometimes I can do it with no problems. But other times I feel like I'm going to throw up. Even when I know I'm hungry. It sucks so bad. I know that sometimes I can do it with no problems but the fact that I still have to think about and not just do it really irks me. I just want to be normal. Go out to dinners/party's and just eat a bunch of food and have fun with everyone. I should note that when we are home by ourselves I eat like a pig.

I am staying away from any sleep medications because I have IBS too and they irritate it. So, yes. That is pretty much it. I had a really bad anxiety attack because I was afraid of getting nightmares(I get them a lot) and now I can't get sleep at all.

If you work for an employer they normally work out how much tax etc you owe and it's deducted at source so what you get in your pay check is yours. But if you're self employed you have to fill in a tax return each year. You can fill in the return from the 6th April and it has to be done by 31st January the following year. So the tax return I've just submitted is for tax year 2020-2021.\n\nI hate doing my tax return. My accounts are really simple, profits easy to calculate and very few expenses. But I'm so paranoid I'll do something wrong. There's so many different fields to fill in and I have no clue what half of them mean. I've always asked my sister to sit with me in the past when I do my returns but this year I did it all on my own.\n\nTo further complicate matters my accounts last year are screwed up because of coronavirus. My income was down ~75% but I was eligible for a government support scheme called the Self Employment Income Support Scheme. However I then had to declare all these figures on my tax returns which was even more boxes to tick.\n\nI also had to claim my fifth grant which means working out my turnover for the last two years etc. and freaking out that I'll somehow claim the wrong amount or screw something up.\n\nIt took me two weeks of staring at the folder to build up the courage and then about half an hour ago I finally hit that sweet spot of the anxiety of not doing it outweighing the anxiety of doing it (the grant deadline is September).

Use \"reflection\" to your advantage: Reflecting on what the other person has said can help you understand their perspective and show that you're actively listening. This can also give you a moment to gather your thoughts and respond in a more mindful way.\n4. Embrace your uniqueness: Everyone has their own way of communicating, and there's no one \"right\" way to do it.

As a result, many people are fearing that COVID-19 restrictions will be constantly looming over us for the rest of human history, persistently drifting in and out of our lives. I'd like to explain why these fears simply are not rational. Despite what some say, Israel has not achieved herd immunity. They are very close, of course, but they are not at that milestone *yet.* About 5,160,000 Israelis are fully vaccinated, equivalent to roughly 56% of the Israeli population is fully vaccinated. Add that to all the Israelis who have attained natural immunity from the virus, and the percentage rate of immunity within Israel arrives at roughly 66%. For a group to have herd immunity to COVID-19, 70% must be immune. Because Israel has yet to achieve herd immunity, it is still possible for an outbreak to take place. Even with this in mind, the outbreak Israel has been facing is minuscule compared to the size of outbreaks at any point in 2020.

I've been doing a lot of thinking, lately, and I think I've finally got a handle on why the pandemic has been so chronically stressful for me, and others, over the past year. Specifically those in first world countries, in relation to how it affects us on a psychological level. As people, we tend to experience bad things as happening suddenly, all at once, and then you deal with them. A broken leg, a car wreak, getting fired, getting dumped, etc. Deeply unpleasant, but relatively short-duration things. These are type-1 and type-2 problems; Things which can be avoided, or which can be fixed. But the Coronavirus has loaded us all down with the third type of problem. The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part. Lots of us weren't doing too great before the pandemic hit, but then, after 15 months of slow, grinding lockdowns, endless bad news on top of bad news, and nowhere to go to get away from it... Is it really a wonder why everyone is so unhappy all the time? I feel like a machine that's trying harder and harder to run without lubricant, to the point that it's just scraping metal-on-metal, and every day is a bit harder than the last. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to keep this up. The possibility of a variant wave in the Fall, forcing us back into yet another lockdown, terrifies me. I can't relax, I can't focus, and it's been seven or eight months since I've had any meaningful hope for the future.

{"Reddit ID": "obufss", "Reddit Post": "Hi Folks, Hope y'all have been doing well. I'm from Germany, and I'm well, pretty worried about Delta Variant. I (22f) got my first shot of Biontech last week and so did my sister. My mom is fully vaccinated with Moderna. My stepdad received his first shot of Biontech two days ago. But we also have two kids (age 5 and 3) in our family. Obviously they can't get vaccinated. Hearing that Delta is very transmissible, and often even infects vaccinated folk, scares me. I know efficiency of the vaccines was never 100% but I believed at least we'd be safe from Covid when we get vaccinated. I work full-time and go to school. At school, everyone wears a mask, we are 1,5m apart, the windows are open and everyone gets tested daily. At work, my coworker wears a mask and so do I. When I eat or drink I go outside. Otherwise, I don't take off my mask at all (I wear FFP2 or FFP3). My boss doesn't wear a mask but he only occasionally comes into our office. Also, everyone at my work place had Corona three months ago except me. They caught Alpha (B117). I also have to take public transit. Everyone wears masks. Windows are open. How big is my risk of infection? I have been getting regularly tested since March 21 (1 to 4 times a week) and it came back negative all the time, even when we had a high national incidence and infection was more likely. National incidence is now 5 cases per 100.000 people. In my town it is 3 cases per 100.000 people. At the moment, we have 49 active cases (my town is huge; 500.000 people live here). Do I really have to be worried? I even wear my ffp2 mask when I walk my dog. When I am fully vaccinated, what safety measures should I still follow? I don't mind masks at all, but I'd like to wear makeup someday again lol.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_covid19_support", "Model": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "Based on the information provided, it appears that you have taken several precautions to minimize your risk of infection with the Delta variant of COVID-19.

{"Reddit ID": "od9j5d", "Reddit Post": "Does anyone have any advice on best ways to deal with pretty bad anxiety while living alone and working from home? FWIW, I also live thousands of miles from all of my family. My anxiety got pretty bad several months ago during the holidays when Covid was at its peak and was impossible to see people. I was also still furloughed from work and had a lot of time to think (and overthink). Ive dealt with mild anxiety in the past but nothing like this. During that time it got so bad that I drove thousands of miles to be with relatives. I was able to spend time with them in the evenings which was really helpful and eventually I felt back to normal for the most part. Since then Ive also gotten my job back. However, during the last month Ive gone through a breakup of sorts and that has brought my anxiety back. I lived alone for several years before this and it used to be awesome for me but now it just feels painful. Im almost afraid of being alone. My anxiety is always bad in the mornings; I dont get a lot of sleep because of it which makes it difficult to focus at work. Also, my anxiety gives me get bad stomach aches and I lose my appetite so it makes it really hard to eat. I usually have to force myself to eat every day which just isnt fun. My work is partially opened up and Ive been trying to go in at least a few hours a day just to be around other humans. That helps for sure. Ive been trying to take early morning bike rides as soon as I get up and that typically helps but in the few hours before work starts, Im still rather anxious. Ive tried meditating (which kinda makes things worse), journaling, watching mindless TV, reaching out to friends, etc. I talk to a therapist on a weekly basis which has been helpful. I tried antidepressants (SSRIs) for about 6 months or so and they made my anxiety worse at first and I didnt feel like they were super helpful after that.

I always followed my principles. Right know I'm going back and fourth whether I should go or not. Is it still okay to apply the precautionary principle here and not attend? I mean I'm 3 weeks out from being fully vaccinated. Everyone else there is in a spirit to party because we couldn't for so long. I'm not having that feeling. Quite the opposite.

While the last year and a half have been trying emotionally and professionally for all of us, things are looking up with the vaccine. However, my wife's parents refuse to get vaccinated. They are not in great health and my father-in-law specifically is older and I worry about his health. Therefore, even as things have started to open up, my family has been relatively more conservative, with no masks-free indoor interaction outside of the family, even with people that are vaccinated, for fear of spreading the virus to my inlaws. This is becoming a big problem because I am building a startup and my cofounder is someone I met during the pandemic. He and I need to start building a more regular working cadence and relationship, but this is really difficult since my wife and SIL are not comfortable with me working in person with him, even though he is vaccinated (though he is much less careful than us). For my part, I would like to push the company forward, and agree that our creative work would improve if we were able to work in-person a couple of times per week. I'm just at a loss - my wife is grieving what she perceives as the loss of her parents' sanity and doesn't want to cut them off, but I face real professional challenges (let alone the ongoing personal and mental health challenges) from continuing the status quo.

From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all.

Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up.

My group not only shut down for months, but the general spirit of the group kept going downhill, i tried helping them but ended up feeling just as bad as them if not worse. After a painful year of online class (which i could barely even do cus my wifi had given up on me), I thankfully was able to get even both shots of the Moderna vaccine. But even after all that, the group hasn't changed. Whenever someone asks to go out, we get the same answers like \"i can't, i need to study/work\", \"I'll be there next weeks (it's the 4th time they said that) and the spirit is still doom and gloom. I want to find some other friends, but due to how stuck to their circles people are here I'm afraid I'll never be able to find someone else who likes me. What can i do which can help me?

{"Reddit ID": "ldud2", "Reddit Post": "So, I'm doing some soul searching about my motorcycle.  I've ridden for six years, and have about 100,000 miles under my belt.  I've always been extremely responsible, I've worn all the gear, all the time, gotten the training, and obey traffic laws.  My wife, bless her, has never pressured me to leave them behind.  In fact she pressures the exact opposite since she doesn't want to hear me gripe about not having a bike.\n\nMy son is thirteen months old.  Every time I leave on the bike I make sure the last thing I say to him, and my wife is that I love them.  A small part of this is too ensure that if I'm on the bike and my number comes up, the last thing I've said to them is the most important thing that needs to be said.\n\nI don't think I can do this anymore.  Today, while riding, I just couldn't stop thinking about how absurd my little ritual is since I'm actually out there doing something that increases the likely hood that my innocent \"I love you\" really will the last thing they hear me say.\n\nSo, I'm curious how other bikers dealt with this.  Did you give it up? Do you regret it?  I can't help but feel like the pang of regret I might feel on a sunny day with no bike would probably be outweighed with a satisfied feeling of duty to my family.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_parenting", "Model": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "As a fellow biker, I understand your concerns about the risks of riding and the impact it may have on your family.

Is it possible to do both 1/2 public and 1/2 home somehow?\n\nEdit: I guess I should clarify- I no way intend to keep my daughter out of social activities, I would most likely have her attend a home-schooling co-op should my decision sway this way.

Also, I know how home-schooling can be abused (and why that is one reason it is controversial), my partner and I are both very open minded, free-thinking people who love to explore all realms of ideologies and theories (in other words we aren't going to shove her in Jesus camp and tell her that everyone is evil and wrong except us), also I would have her attend summer camps or maybe join a club so that she would get plenty of social interaction not to mention give us both a brief break from one another (kids need space too!). \n\nI just want her to have a better experience than I did in public schools. I wish I'd learned what I know now back then (I guess we all do) but the classes I was offered were mostly test-prep and my teachers were very, how you say, \"Do what I say, don't ask questions, shut up sit down\" etc...\n\nWe can't afford private school, but there are other school systems I'm looking into, and I have years to decide, I just want to be informed is all. \n\nThanks for everyone's input, I greatly appreciate it!", "Sub-Reddit": "r_parenting", "Model": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "Sure, I'd be happy to help!

Her doctor prescribed a roll-on type of gel to stop the sweating in her palms and feet, but it is such a hassle to use, we don't bother. You actually have to apply it before bedtime, then wrap the hands and feet in gauze, then cover with plastic. Wtf?\n\n\nEvery time I hold her hand sh'es embarrassed because her hands are soaking wet. When she does homework she has to get up and wash and dry her hands several times. It's very frustrating to her. She's worried she will never get to have a boyfriend, because every time she'll hold hands with him, her palms will be soaking wet. I feel terrible for her, and I have never known anyone personally who has this problem.\n\n\nAnyways, I understand there is a very minor, hardly invasive surgery available for this, wherein the doctor makes a small incision between two of the rids, and basically snips and cauterizes the nerve that triggers this sweating.

Children's museums and zoos: The New Jersey Children's Museum and the Turtle Back Zoo in West Orange are great places to visit with young children.

These include the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area and the Cape May Bird Observatory.\n5. Cooking and baking: Young children love to help in the kitchen, so try setting up a simple cooking or baking activity with your nephew.

You could put on some upbeat tunes and have a dance party, or you could try a music-making activity like playing with maracas or a drum.\n7. Sensory play: Young children are naturally curious and love exploring their senses. Set up some sensory play activities, such as a ball pit or a sensory bin filled with rice, beans, or sand.\n8. Building and construction: Provide your nephew with building materials like blocks, LEGO, or magnetic tiles.

{"Reddit ID": "ee559", "Reddit Post": "Hello all - my husband and I have been trying to figure out if the amount of attention we get in public with our little girl is normal.  She's 8 months old and as cute as can be.  The thing is - we get a LOT of attention when we go out with her.  Is this normal?  She's our first, and I was in no way prepared for the number of people who would stop us, want to see her, want to take pictures of her, want to ooohh and ahhh over her all the time.  \n\nI'm sure as she gets a little older, this will decrease.  It was flattering at first, but it's beginning to be a bit of a hassle sometimes.  For example, I took her to Chipotle for lunch today.  While I ate (20 minutes) nine different people came up to me to talk about her.  It made it really hard to finish my meal.  At the same time, I noticed that another baby in the restaurant who was around the same age didn't get any of this attention.  \n\nSo, parents of reddit, is this a reasonable amount of attention to expect when taking a baby out in public?

You can also try to plan your outings during less busy times or avoid high-traffic areas to minimize interruptions.\n\nAs for protecting your baby from germs, it's essential to wash your hands frequently, especially before handling your baby, and to ensure that anyone holding or interacting with your baby does the same.

I'll have to do a follow up after the showdown this weekend.  There will even be police.  Should be interesting.\n\n\n***DETAILS(edit):\n\nOkay, sorry. I'll try to make it short.\n\nBasically he is pissed at me because of some legal stuff between his mom and myself (we've been apart for 10+ years). He started off by not wanting to come to my house for my parenting time. So, like an freakin' idiot trying to be a cool dad I let it slide. 10 weeks later he stomping his foot and still saying that I can't make him come over. I'm supposed to have him every weekend and haven't seen him for 2 1/2 months. During that time we were trying to do counseling (he and I) to get it worked out. After 3 sessions he stomped his foot again and refused to go.\n\nSoooo, I finally laid down the law - literally. Told him I was picking him up this Friday and that was that. He stomped his foot and said \"you can't make me\", but it turns out that \"YEAH I CAN\". So i told him that and also how I was going to do it. It involves the police and a neat little thing called a Civil Standby (Civil Assist).\n\nHence the \" I hate you!!!\"\n\nIt's a bit more complicated than that, but does that help clear it up?\n\n\n\n**Second Edit:\n\nThe worst part is that he really is a great kid.

{"Reddit ID": "pp4ky", "Reddit Post": "So, my day care sent home a readymade bottle for my 5mo old (They were about to feed him, but it was the end of the day, so i just took it with me). We usually give him 6oz in a bottle, and this bottle was full almost to the brim. This is a [Playtex DropIn](http://playtexbaby.com/Bottles/Dropins/Premium-Nurser) bottle, FYI. \n\nSo I call up the day care and ask them what the deal is, this is much more than 6oz of formula. They tell me that they premix the formula, measure it in a separate measuring cup, and then pour 6oz of formula solution in the bottle. This confounds me, so I do a little experiment of my own. I grab my own measuring cup, fill it with 6oz of water, and pour it into the bottle. Lo and behold, it fills to something like 7.5 oz according to the markings on the side of the bottle. \n\nAm I completely missing something here, or is Playtex being very irresponsible about their dropin measurements?

I know an +/- an oz or two isn't really detrimental to my kid as long as he's happy and pooping normally, but I still find this very bizarre.\n\n**Update: I got some Playtex liners, and lo and behold, 6oz of water is now an accurate measurement both in a measuring cup and in a liner.
