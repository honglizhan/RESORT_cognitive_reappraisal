Additionally, it may be helpful to recognize what is upsetting you and think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control your (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset you. In situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others' perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.

If I never get my hopes up for a single thing and always expect the worst than I will never be disappointed, right? In theory, yes. But I've realized being so negative about absolutely everything has lead to my angry, miserable existence. Everything irritates me, everyone is annoying or stupid in my mind. And honestly it makes me so angry, ALL. THE. TIME. I'm sick of living like this. I know what my issue is but I have no clue how to even begin to fix it. I wish I was a positive person who woke up in the morning and looked forward to living but I'm just not and I'm afraid if I don't find some way to bring at least a little positivity into my thought process, I will be miserable forever.

Since I've moved my things into our room I avoid our group chat and things that remind me of her because I get sudden overwhelming feelings &amp; feelings of annoyance. \n\nI'm assuming that I'm feeling annoyed with her right now because I'm anxious about going back to school, a new room assignment, living with others, and starting a new routine.

How have you overcome it and whats your approach to handling the changes in these relationships?\n\nI like to think Ive improved how I approach my anger in my relationships (Ive learned to keep things to myself by being more quiet and not engaging in gatherings / discussions as much). The issue is that this has caused me to become more distant and I keep to myself a lot more. I don't spend time with my family out of fear that they'll make me angry and Ill develop a deeper hatred for them which I don't want.\n\nIt feels like theres no winning because if I was as social and spent more time with them, it creates more opportunity for arguments and my anger to come out. My only approach has been to distance myself and develop a more surface-level small-talk type relationship.

I get extremely angry and violent when my mom does things that I've asked her not to do, sometimes it involves other people but mostly my mom since I'm around her the most. I get that it might be a teenager thing but I desperately want to find a way to stop letting it take control over me because it's getting a bit debilitating. Even though I don't let her see my anger and I don't yell at her (since she can out-yell me and would probably send me to my dad's forever), I feel terrible for feeling this way toward the person that took care of me my entire life.\n\nThis morning, she was drying her clothes after I had just done laundry, so she took my clothes out of the dryer and put them into a hamper thing. I've asked her multiple times to let me know if she needs the machine when my clothes are still in there (since we tend to do our laundry at the same time for some reason) because I get irrationally mad when she touches my clothes. It doesn't happen too often since I usually take my clothes out and fold them before she even notices I did laundry, but I forget every once in a while and every time it makes my day a bit worse. I told her today that I don't care if it's 4am and I'm asleep, I want her to at least warn me that she's going to touch my clothes if I don't get up right away. \n\nI went back to my room after taking my clothes and I wanted to scream but I always manage to stop myself by just pretending to yell and by punching my mattress and pillows.

{"Reddit ID": "Anger_112", "Reddit Post": "I (27F) rarely get super angry with my mom or other family, but the past few days have been one of those rare times. I am justified in my anger, but I feel so immensely guilty for being angry. I tried ignoring my parents and brother and I even ignored one text from my mom. I cried and cried, not because I was angry, but because I felt so guilty and it was tearing me apart. I went to work upset, and tried to play off my watery eyes on my allergies. It really messed me up and as soon as I clocked out and got in my car to head home, I started crying again. It's like I want to be angry and I know I have reason to be, but I keep thinking about how \"what if something happens to them and the last thing they knew was that you didn't want to speak to them.\" I just keep thinking how I don't want to lose my mom or my brother. I want to be on good terms with them because I don't want something bad to happen. This is really affecting my ability to dispel my anger and deal with it in a normal way. I have always noticed that I feel guilt when I get angry at my family, but this time it has been full force. I've even been getting migraines because of how stressed out I have been over this.

I mean I guess I'm different from my father there, my father never admits he's wrong or sincere or sorry for anything he does, where as I do, I'm sorry for everything I do wrong. I spend hours bashing myself for every little thing I do wrong, when it comes to yelling or anything. I just don't know what to do about my anger issues. Any suggestions?

{"Reddit ID": "Anger_124", "Reddit Post": "Hello everyone. First post here, I am hoping I don't break any rules.\n\nI have been having anger issues for a long time now. I had anger issues in kindergarten and in elementary school and have been to a psychologist in second grade because my situation was that bad. Nowadays, the issues are much worse, I have lots of stress on me currently with online school and all kinds of things related to it, I am very tired because I am also not getting enough sleep.\n\nWhenever I get angry, I usually just have to smash whatever it is in my hand (controller, pen, notebook etc) against the surface that is closest to me, let it be my desk or bed. This has not only caused me and my family hundreds of dollars of damages, but I also usually get hurt in the process. Sure, wounds can heal, but having them in the first place because of a mental breakdown because my pen has dried out is a pretty fucked up thing in my book. \n\nI tried putting said things down before starting to hit something, but I just have zero self control and can't consistently do so. I also tried calming myself down by just staying still and doing nothing, but that usually gets me even more angry and I cause more harm to myself. I tried hitting other things like my pillows, but that causes almost the same effect as staying still. And after I break something I get sober and realize what I just did and get a bad feeling of doom or whatever that is.\n\nIs there any way I can at the very least minimize these breakouts? It's starting to get very expensive and I have a feeling if this worsens, many other things are on the way that could completely ruin me, as if I am not that bad already.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_anger", "Model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "It sounds like you are struggling with anger issues and causing damage to yourself and others. It's important to remember that it's okay to feel angry and frustrated, but it's not healthy to hold onto those feelings indefinitely.\n\nOne way to minimize these breakouts is to practice mindfulness and self-awareness. This means being present in the moment and paying attention to your thoughts and emotions without judgment. When you start to feel angry, try taking a deep breath and focusing on your breath. This can help calm your mind and reduce feelings of stress and anxiety.\n\nAnother helpful technique is to practice positive self-talk. Instead of focusing on the negative aspects of the situation, try reframing it in a more positive light. For example, instead of saying \"I can't do this,\" say \"I can do this, I just need to take it one step at a time.\"\n\nIt's also important to seek support from others.

I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh. \n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, \"oh hes not that,\" and move on.

Hi I have social anxiety and I was wondering, there's this girl that occasionally walks past me in the hallway and we were classmates for one year in a class and I have tried to initiate contact with her. She actually said she liked me 2 years prior (we have 1.5 years of online school), but I ghosted her which was very dumb and entirely my fault. I have miserably failed because of my social anxiety around her. My heart races and my mind goes blank with hesitation every time I'm around her. I haven't really talked to her for 2 years, so I am thinking that I would come off as a creep if I were to talk to her. And she typically walks at a 4mph rate, with arms crossed, looking down, so I don't really know if randomly saying hello would come off as weird or not, or if she doesn't even see me. She is sorta anti-social, yet dresses very nicely with makeup and jewelry. I was just wondering if randomly saying hi to her after 2 years would be creepy?

I haven't really been able to eat since i started and i barely sleep anymore because i am so anxious and constantly dreading the next shift, and the rest of the week because i only have two days off.

I am crying at night when i get home and in the morning before shifts and i'm not even able to do anything else but stress out until I go in. I know this isn't a starbucks issue it's more personal, but i've worked as a barista before in a small local coffee shop and i was completely comfortable after only a few shifts. I don't know what steps to take to help myself right now and I was wondering if the job is really worth all the stress and anxiety. i try many coping techniques like breathing and the 333, and journaling and talking it out or just crying to expel whatever i need to, but it's like a never ending cycle help.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_anxiety", "Model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "It's understandable that starting a new job can be overwhelming, especially when you're not fully prepared.

{"Reddit ID": "Anxiety_38", "Reddit Post": "After therapy today, there was this outdoor cat that the lady across the street owned (with a ton of other cats btw) It's really cute so while I was waiting to get picked up, I wanted to see if it would become friendly with me (she's a little scared of humans). It ended up working and she became really friendly! Ended up brushing up against me everywhere, licked my hand (no open wound), and other things like that. At some point, i think she was trying to lick me again but i felt her tooth on my leg. No bite mark, but what I think might be a pimple on my leg, idfk lmao, and thus no blood (however i keep noticing stories of people who get rabies from seemingly invisible bite marks, but those are from bats, not cats). \n\nAt first, I was fine... and then I looked up \"rabies\" on Google, and here I am 8 hours later still researching it. I remember looking up symptoms of rabies while the cat was just chilling there lol. Anyway, I read a bunch of shit. The cat looked friendly, like any normal outdoor cat. It was a little shy around new people but got accustomed to you if you gave it the chance to. \n\nI honestly don't think I have it, but I have this compulsion to read and read until the feeling is numb and i get fatigued. It's just tough. Can someone reassure me or something/also tell me if I have rabies or not?

This is my first time posting on here. I will be 19 in two days, I have been struggling with anxiety, and depression for about three years now, at least that's when it got really bad. I panic through out all day almost every day about every little thing and I am in bed all day every day, too scared to stay standing up for longer than going to get food or to the bathroom before I run back to my bed. This has gotten so bad I'm unable to work, socialize with friends and family, or do something as simple as take my dog for a walk. I am barely holding on and I can't handle much more of this. I was prescribed Cipralex a few months ago and I only took that for a few days because medication is one of the many things that give me anxiety, and than I search every little thing and scare myself into even feeling sick. Today I was prescribed sertraline, and I even went to pick it up and it's in my medicine cabinet now. I read up on this medication for so long and I'm so scared to start it not knowing what to expect, so I guess I'm just looking for advice and to hear other peoples stories and hopefully gain some motivation and courage to start this medication that could potentially change my life.

I have very thick hair, so a lot of it was coming out. I've had severe brain fog, which hasn't been the least bit helpful during a time when I have to be the most alert and *with it*'. I've had no appetite, and now my trousers are all loose, with one  pair literally falling down when I walk. The most bizarre symptom I've had is this weird jaw tension - my jaw is very clicky, and it feels incredibly tense and stiff. As a hypochondriac, I was convinced this was a heart attack, but I was reassured that it's probably just anxiety. I've had weird gastrointestinal symptoms, where I feel nauseous, and have this pit in my stomach all of the time, which could be caused by the lack of eating, but it persists even when I have eaten. \n\nAnd then of course feelings of impending doom, etc etc. \n\nI just can't wait for this to be over.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_anxiety", "Model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "It sounds like the narrator is feeling overwhelmed with the pressure to achieve high grades in their A levels.

I've had extreme anxiety and panic attacks since I was in kindergarten. Nothing was ever \"easy\" for me and still is not. Sometimes I feel like in order to do anything I have to use all of my energy, whereas other people can do it and use almost no energy.\n\nI have tried many things to help my anxiety, but still it persists. I have been to counseling, which helped slightly, I am on anxiety medicine too since counseling did not help enough. Even with anxiety medicine, I still struggle with anxiety and because of it, depression. My anxiety medicine seems to have bad side effects, like no sex drive, super irregular periods, tiredness, night sweats. I would say it slightly helps but I also wonder sometimes if it is just a placebo affect in my mind.\n\n I struggle to work, be social or anything \"normal\" people do. The longest I have had a job was 7 months straight before I quit and changed jobs. I am a hard worker when my anxiety doesn't get the best of me and I have excelled in any job I have done. I've even excelled in school and just got my Associates degree. Now I am incredibly anxious because I need to get a job again now that I completed school but all I can think of is how anxious it makes me. I don't like to make mistakes or get in trouble, and I do everything in my power to do things right, however I know it is IMPOSSIBLE to be perfect. Life would just be much simpler if this feeling of anxiousness wasn't there for every little thing I try to do in my life.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_anxiety", "Model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "It sounds like the narrator is struggling with anxiety and feeling overwhelmed by the challenges they face in their life.

Even when they're generally nice and good to me, this instance of being negative affects me to the point where I cannot see anything but it and not feel anything for them but... aversion? \n\nMaybe it's possible to go through life and avoid such people altogether, but I'm sure there are situations where you somehow just have to deal with it, being in a relationship at times or maybe in a workplace environment or with family members. \n\nI've asked him to stop many times, it's gotten better, a bit, but I don't think he'll ever stop, and I cannot control him or other people, so I'd like to find a way to control it within myself. To not take it as personal and devastatingly as I do. The anxiousness it gives me overpowers anything and everything. My thoughts, my emotions, my actions in ways. \n\nSo, does anyone have tips for me to try?", "Sub-Reddit": "r_anxiety", "Model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "It's understandable that dealing with your SO's raging during gaming can be stressful and overwhelming.

I didn't want to look weak, so I laughed out loud and yelled back \"you mad!\" then he snapped back with \"nobody needs to know y'all are having sex!\" and then kept goin on and on with his aggressive shouting. finally I go \"alright, alright\" and he walks away talking under his breath.\n\nalso, I'd like to make it a point I think it's super interesting he says \"nobody needs to know\" instead of \"nobody needs to hear.\" like maybe he's projecting something?\n\nanyways, my partner was ready to go out there and say something but I stopped him bc my anxiety was peaking like crazy!

Hello!\n\nI'm not really able to seek therapy for the moment, but I'm doing everything I can to help myself. I unfortunately ended up abusing substances for a period of time but I'm sober now and dealing with things a little better. I'm just looking to see if anyone can relate to my experience with anxiety.\n\nFor me, there is no particular thing I get anxious about, no particular situation. I'm fine with phone calls, public speaking, all the classics. \n\nI get anxious when I have to do tasks that may reflect on my ability, intelligence, or self-worth. I also get anxious when I have to do things to achieve something that I care about. The sad thing is that I'm a huge procrastinator due to that. Avoidance and procrastination are how I cope. The issue is that it branched out so much it affects almost every activity. Most of the time though there is no other thing I should be doing. It's just me trying to do something, becoming more and more anxious and dropping it.\n\nIf I think I wanna work out, I'm anxious because I think I should be doing work. If I wanna work, I'm anxious because I think I should work on personal projects. If I wanna work on personal projects, I'm anxious because I think I should work out. It never ends. \n\nI don't get panic attacks or a faster heart rate or anything, I just get a deep sense of dread and tunnel vision if that makes sense, it's just an \"oh shit\" feeling that I can't shake.\n\nAnyone relate to this?

To top it off, I have an important exam in less than 6 days and I really want to score high. However, I am really afraid that I won't be able to wakeup at the time that I want to because I am not getting sleep. And of course, I can't start studying now because I am really sleep deprived.

New poster so I apologize for any mistakes! \n\nI've been dealing with anxiety and panic attacks since I was in middle school, and I know that they are caused by abandonment issues, as well as some insecurities. I know exactly what my triggers are, why they happen and what specific fear is causing them....so for the most part I have been able to manage it without medication or therapy. Unfortunately, things began to peak two years ago during the beginning of covid and my stress and anxiety ended up actually causing shingles. After this, and getting covid, a few other random symptoms began to occur during major anxiety episodes. These still happen to this day, when it gets bad enough, but doctors have assured me these symptoms are my \"post covid norm now\". A lot happened in that time to cause it, so it wasn't one specific trigger like it used to be. Ever since, I have had a much more difficult time controlling the spiraling that occurs once the thoughts creep in. It is now affecting my personal relationships as well. \n\nMy question is, how are you able to manage the physical and emotional symptoms of anxiety when a major episode does occur? Is medication and therapy really the best and only solution?", "Sub-Reddit": "r_anxiety", "Model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "It sounds like you have a good understanding of your triggers and how to manage your anxiety.

{"Reddit ID": "Anxiety_111", "Reddit Post": "Just wanted to share with someone that I filed my tax return all on my own!\n\nFor those outside England a quick simplified brief on our tax system.  If you work for an employer they normally work out how much tax etc you owe and it's deducted at source so what you get in your pay check is yours. But if you're self employed you have to fill in a tax return each year. You can fill in the return from the 6th April and it has to be done by 31st January the following year. So the tax return I've just submitted is for tax year 2020-2021.\n\nI hate doing my tax return. My accounts are really simple, profits easy to calculate and very few expenses. But I'm so paranoid I'll do something wrong. There's so many different fields to fill in and I have no clue what half of them mean. I've always asked my sister to sit with me in the past when I do my returns but this year I did it all on my own.\n\nTo further complicate matters my accounts last year are screwed up because of coronavirus. My income was down ~75% but I was eligible for a government support scheme called the Self Employment Income Support Scheme. However I then had to declare all these figures on my tax returns which was even more boxes to tick.\n\nI also had to claim my fifth grant which means working out my turnover for the last two years etc. and freaking out that I'll somehow claim the wrong amount or screw something up.\n\nIt took me two weeks of staring at the folder to build up the courage and then about half an hour ago I finally hit that sweet spot of the anxiety of not doing it outweighing the anxiety of doing it (the grant deadline is September).

I lost my uncle who is my best friend, we lived abroad all our lives but because of the pandemic I returned home, and barely managed to see him those 2 years. He was the kindest and purest human being. I met him briefly yesterday as we took him to the hospital. Today he passed away from COVID, he was deathly afraid from needles and the vaccination. I feel so so powerless. So guilty I didnt reply to his phone call 3 days earlier as my family was also sick of Covid and I was caring for them. The death feels like it could have been avoided, he took the remaining precautions but it didnt work. At least he died happy alongside his family in his hometown where I live. I dont know what or how to live life without him in my mind, without meeting him ever again, with seeing the same places without him. Im tired, I want to cry. We both hated living at home now I am stuck living on earth without him, I feel this home is the right place for me - was waiting eagerly for him to return.

As a result, many people are fearing that COVID-19 restrictions will be constantly looming over us for the rest of human history, persistently drifting in and out of our lives. I'd like to explain why these fears simply are not rational. Despite what some say, Israel has not achieved herd immunity. They are very close, of course, but they are not at that milestone *yet.* About 5,160,000 Israelis are fully vaccinated, equivalent to roughly 56% of the Israeli population is fully vaccinated. Add that to all the Israelis who have attained natural immunity from the virus, and the percentage rate of immunity within Israel arrives at roughly 66%. For a group to have herd immunity to COVID-19, 70% must be immune. Because Israel has yet to achieve herd immunity, it is still possible for an outbreak to take place. Even with this in mind, the outbreak Israel has been facing is minuscule compared to the size of outbreaks at any point in 2020.

After the third and a half week or so, I felt well enough to put in a full workout. I did so, and 48 hours later, my Covid symptoms had returned in pretty much full force. I've read about different forms \"long Covid\" takes - it's not always persistent - some report reinfection or reactivation of Covid after periods of dormancy. Two weeks after my initial reactivation, my symptoms begin to subside. I decide to get the first Covid vaccine (I read that in some \"vaccine vanguard\" countries like Israel, they were recommending one covid shot for those who had already had the virus). I get the first shot, and feel a little not great for about 48 hours or so (mild discomfort in lymph nodes, some fatigue, weakness), but afterwards I begin to feel great, better than I had at any point since before I got Covid in early May. A week ago I put in a full exercise. About 24 hours later, I don't feel like I felt when I had Covid, but I definitely feel the exact same as I did *after* I had gotten my first shot - mild discomfort in lymph nodes, some weakness. I am under the impression working out a second time \"reactivated\" dormant Covid, but the vaccine kicked back in and enlisted my immune system in fighting this second activation. Finding information about the virus at this time has been so frustrating - official counsel has lagged internet anecdotes and similar by a considerable amount of time.

{"Reddit ID": "o93rqd", "Reddit Post": "Hey, everyone, just in a particularly dark patch, and feeling the need for some dialogue. I've been doing a lot of thinking, lately, and I think I've finally got a handle on why the pandemic has been so chronically stressful for me, and others, over the past year. Specifically those in first world countries, in relation to how it affects us on a psychological level. As people, we tend to experience bad things as happening suddenly, all at once, and then you deal with them. A broken leg, a car wreak, getting fired, getting dumped, etc. Deeply unpleasant, but relatively short-duration things. These are type-1 and type-2 problems; Things which can be avoided, or which can be fixed. But the Coronavirus has loaded us all down with the third type of problem. The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part. Lots of us weren't doing too great before the pandemic hit, but then, after 15 months of slow, grinding lockdowns, endless bad news on top of bad news, and nowhere to go to get away from it... Is it really a wonder why everyone is so unhappy all the time? I feel like a machine that's trying harder and harder to run without lubricant, to the point that it's just scraping metal-on-metal, and every day is a bit harder than the last. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to keep this up. The possibility of a variant wave in the Fall, forcing us back into yet another lockdown, terrifies me. I can't relax, I can't focus, and it's been seven or eight months since I've had any meaningful hope for the future. This late in the game, I just... can't shake the feeling that things will never get better. 2019 was the best things will ever be in my lifetime, and it's all downhill from here.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_covid19_support", "Model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "It sounds like the narrator is feeling overwhelmed by the pandemic and its effects on their life.

{"Reddit ID": "obufss", "Reddit Post": "Hi Folks, Hope y'all have been doing well. I'm from Germany, and I'm well, pretty worried about Delta Variant. I (22f) got my first shot of Biontech last week and so did my sister. My mom is fully vaccinated with Moderna. My stepdad received his first shot of Biontech two days ago. But we also have two kids (age 5 and 3) in our family. Obviously they can't get vaccinated. Hearing that Delta is very transmissible, and often even infects vaccinated folk, scares me. I know efficiency of the vaccines was never 100% but I believed at least we'd be safe from Covid when we get vaccinated. I work full-time and go to school. At school, everyone wears a mask, we are 1,5m apart, the windows are open and everyone gets tested daily. At work, my coworker wears a mask and so do I. When I eat or drink I go outside. Otherwise, I don't take off my mask at all (I wear FFP2 or FFP3). My boss doesn't wear a mask but he only occasionally comes into our office. Also, everyone at my work place had Corona three months ago except me. They caught Alpha (B117). I also have to take public transit. Everyone wears masks. Windows are open. How big is my risk of infection? I have been getting regularly tested since March 21 (1 to 4 times a week) and it came back negative all the time, even when we had a high national incidence and infection was more likely. National incidence is now 5 cases per 100.000 people. In my town it is 3 cases per 100.000 people. At the moment, we have 49 active cases (my town is huge; 500.000 people live here). Do I really have to be worried? I even wear my ffp2 mask when I walk my dog. When I am fully vaccinated, what safety measures should I still follow? I don't mind masks at all, but I'd like to wear makeup someday again lol.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_covid19_support", "Model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "It's understandable to be concerned about the Delta variant, especially given its high transmissibility and ability to infect vaccinated individuals. However, it's important to remember that the vaccines still provide significant protection against severe illness and hospitalization, even if they may not be 100% effective against infection.\n\nGiven your vaccination status and the safety measures you're taking at work and school, your risk of infection may be lower than you think. It's also worth noting that the incidence of COVID-19 in your town is relatively low, which further reduces your risk.\n\nThat being said, it's always a good idea to continue following safety measures such as wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and washing your hands regularly. When you're fully vaccinated, you may be able to relax some of these measures, but it's important to continue monitoring the situation and follow guidelines from public health officials.\n\nIt's also important to remember that you have control over what you can do to protect yourself and others, and that it's okay to take breaks and prioritize self-care.

Well, due to my school being concerned about the tools having germs on them, the course was cancelled. Now, as of September 2021, I'm in Grade 11. I amazingly had this course at the exact wrong time. I contacted my school to allow me to take this course this year but they didn't make an exception.

The UK is full of Delta and the borders are heavily restricted. 10 days of mandatory quarantine plus an expensive mandatory \"test package\" which I cannot afford. Very few countries are exempt from this, almost entirely small islands around the world. Meanwhile Denmark's infection numbers have doubled, yay European football events. So the hopes of ever getting on the UK's green list are smaller and smaller. I have since the start of this whole thing been worrying about loved ones. First my elderly grandparents for being high risk, then my best friend who had her baby very premature, then my mum was bedridden for months due to covid, and now my dad has cancer and has to have chemo. It has been almost a full year since I saw a single family member, more than a year for many of them. And not even a glimmer of hope. I am fully vaccinated even, and I am watching people here happy about losing restrictions, but I am so scared of losing someone after being away for so long and it's getting more and more overwhelming. I know nobody can say magic words to fix things, I just really needed to vent about how it's July 2021 and this is still ongoing for the foreseeable future.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_covid19_support", "Model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "I understand how difficult and overwhelming this situation must be for you.

{"Reddit ID": "od9j5d", "Reddit Post": "Does anyone have any advice on best ways to deal with pretty bad anxiety while living alone and working from home? FWIW, I also live thousands of miles from all of my family. My anxiety got pretty bad several months ago during the holidays when Covid was at its peak and was impossible to see people. I was also still furloughed from work and had a lot of time to think (and overthink). Ive dealt with mild anxiety in the past but nothing like this. During that time it got so bad that I drove thousands of miles to be with relatives. I was able to spend time with them in the evenings which was really helpful and eventually I felt back to normal for the most part. Since then Ive also gotten my job back. However, during the last month Ive gone through a breakup of sorts and that has brought my anxiety back. I lived alone for several years before this and it used to be awesome for me but now it just feels painful. Im almost afraid of being alone. My anxiety is always bad in the mornings; I dont get a lot of sleep because of it which makes it difficult to focus at work. Also, my anxiety gives me get bad stomach aches and I lose my appetite so it makes it really hard to eat. I usually have to force myself to eat every day which just isnt fun. My work is partially opened up and Ive been trying to go in at least a few hours a day just to be around other humans. That helps for sure. Ive been trying to take early morning bike rides as soon as I get up and that typically helps but in the few hours before work starts, Im still rather anxious. Ive tried meditating (which kinda makes things worse), journaling, watching mindless TV, reaching out to friends, etc. I talk to a therapist on a weekly basis which has been helpful. I tried antidepressants (SSRIs) for about 6 months or so and they made my anxiety worse at first and I didnt feel like they were super helpful after that. TLDR; Any tips as to how to get out of my head and regain that sense of safety to be alone again after suffering anxiety because of the pandemic?", "Sub-Reddit": "r_covid19_support", "Model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "It sounds like you're struggling with anxiety while living alone and working from home. It's important to remember that it's okay to feel anxious in these situations, and that there are things you can do to help manage your anxiety.\n\nOne thing that might be helpful is to try to focus on the things that you can control, rather than the things that you can't. For example, you can control how you react to your anxiety and how you choose to spend your time. You can also try to focus on the things that bring you joy and happiness, even if they're small.\n\nIt might also be helpful to try to establish a routine and structure in your day. This can help you feel more in control and give you a sense of purpose.

Don't ask me about the legitimacy of that argument though) The goal here is to get a mask with a high degree of protection against covid. My mother is aged and smokes a lot and my country is in the middle of a covid delta variant spike so I need a high degree of protection.

Well she's my friend as well since I know her since I was little because her son is one of my best friends growing up. There will probably be 50ish guests there (don't know exactly, could be more). It is planned to be a garden party but forecast says rain, so it's probably indoors. It's in my hometown, so I would need to travel there a few hours to attend. I haven't seen many of the people attending there since last year including some of my friends. Mainly because I didn't want to meet because of the virus. I only texted with them. Cases are very low (sometimes zero) there. Some people there are fully vaccinated, some got their 1st shot and some haven't yet. I got my first shot 3 weeks ago(Moderna). I haven't met such a big group since last summer. Only smaller groups and always outdoors. You can probably tell by now that I'm a very careful person when it comes to dealing with the virus. I always followed my principles. Right know I'm going back and fourth whether I should go or not. Is it still okay to apply the precautionary principle here and not attend? I mean I'm 3 weeks out from being fully vaccinated. Everyone else there is in a spirit to party because we couldn't for so long. I'm not having that feeling. Quite the opposite.

I live in Italy and here we had three lockdowns, the last one ending around May. They left me absolutely burnt out. Sometimes I just feel like I'm in a different universe than I was in two years ago and nothing makes sense anymore. A lot of nice things are happening to me: I am graduating on Monday, I got my vaccine and maybe my boyfriend will finally be able to come visit after 18 months of not seeing each other. But all I can think about is that this will never end and I will be back in lockdown in October. Evertime I'm happy or having fun or trying to make plans for the future I have a little voice in my head saying 'you can't relax because things are never gonna get better and nothing will work out'. I haven't felt true, unconditional joy since maybe August last year. This past year of isolation broke me completely and I feel like I will never be happy again. I hadn't been on antidepressants since 2019 and now I lost all my progress.

While the last year and a half have been trying emotionally and professionally for all of us, things are looking up with the vaccine. However, my wife's parents refuse to get vaccinated. They are not in great health and my father-in-law specifically is older and I worry about his health. Therefore, even as things have started to open up, my family has been relatively more conservative, with no masks-free indoor interaction outside of the family, even with people that are vaccinated, for fear of spreading the virus to my inlaws. This is becoming a big problem because I am building a startup and my cofounder is someone I met during the pandemic. He and I need to start building a more regular working cadence and relationship, but this is really difficult since my wife and SIL are not comfortable with me working in person with him, even though he is vaccinated (though he is much less careful than us). For my part, I would like to push the company forward, and agree that our creative work would improve if we were able to work in-person a couple of times per week. I'm just at a loss - my wife is grieving what she perceives as the loss of her parents' sanity and doesn't want to cut them off, but I face real professional challenges (let alone the ongoing personal and mental health challenges) from continuing the status quo. Guiltily, I feel very angry at them - I feel like they are offloading responsibility for their safety on my wife, SIL, and myself, which seems extremely selfish.

{"Reddit ID": "oga1in", "Reddit Post": "This lockdown has gone on forever. From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to. I feel like I've become so negative that I don't want to share my thoughts with people because I will bring them down, and I already feel like I pushed some people away by doing this. I emailed multiple psychiatrists, but only one answered me and had one short appointment, and told me I should continue looking because he doesn't have time for new patients.

With that said, Im now seeing more and more reports (including this CNBC report: [url] saying that the new Delta variant will cause the country as a whole to have to reimplement mask and social distancing requirements, especially in states with lower vaccination rates. Consequently, Im feeling increasingly worried that Ill come back in August only to find its gone back to not being safe to see anyone and classes have gone back to being mostly (if not completely) virtual, especially since my home state is one of those mUh FrEeDoMs states with low vaccination rates (granted, Im sure theyd be hesitant to require masks for the same reason, but a lack of that requirement doesnt change how safe or not safe things are).

It's now clear that vaccines alone are not stopping the spread of this thing and vaccinated people are spreading. That means that in a few weeks this wave will be everywhere. I'm worried about kids who are 12 and below who aren't vaccinated. It will be impossible to have any schools open in the fall unless we risk long covid in kids which would be unimaginable. I'm worried about the African American population which is only 33% vaccinated.

I'm a 19 year old autistic Italian boy, but despite being on the spectrum right before the pandemic started I've had a big progress at socializing with people, I hung out with big groups among my friends every Saturday night, we had so much fun, and then the pandemic happened. My group not only shut down for months, but the general spirit of the group kept going downhill, i tried helping them but ended up feeling just as bad as them if not worse.

You could try joining a new club or group, volunteering, or reaching out to other people in your community.\n\nIt's also important to recognize what is upsetting you and think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control your (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset you.\n\nIf any part of the issue is in your control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If you feel overwhelmed to do this alone, don't hesitate to look for support from friends/family.\n\nIt's also important to consider whether the situation is worth your attention. If it's not, it might be helpful to focus on other important things and let go of the stress and anxiety that comes with this situation.\n\nIt's important to note that some situations may be beyond your control, and in those cases, it's important to focus on what you can control and let go of what you can't. It's also important to consider seeking help from professionals if the situation is causing significant distress or difficulty in your life.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to recognize that conflicts of internal values may arise in situations where multiple people interact. What you value is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with your beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts your beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others' perspectives. For instance, if you firmly believe that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind yourself that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.

I've always been extremely responsible, I've worn all the gear, all the time, gotten the training, and obey traffic laws.  My wife, bless her, has never pressured me to leave them behind.

Every time I leave on the bike I make sure the last thing I say to him, and my wife is that I love them.  A small part of this is too ensure that if I'm on the bike and my number comes up, the last thing I've said to them is the most important thing that needs to be said.\n\nI don't think I can do this anymore.  Today, while riding, I just couldn't stop thinking about how absurd my little ritual is since I'm actually out there doing something that increases the likely hood that my innocent \"I love you\" really will the last thing they hear me say.\n\nSo, I'm curious how other bikers dealt with this.

Also, I know how home-schooling can be abused (and why that is one reason it is controversial), my partner and I are both very open minded, free-thinking people who love to explore all realms of ideologies and theories (in other words we aren't going to shove her in Jesus camp and tell her that everyone is evil and wrong except us), also I would have her attend summer camps or maybe join a club so that she would get plenty of social interaction not to mention give us both a brief break from one another (kids need space too!). \n\nI just want her to have a better experience than I did in public schools. I wish I'd learned what I know now back then (I guess we all do) but the classes I was offered were mostly test-prep and my teachers were very, how you say, \"Do what I say, don't ask questions, shut up sit down\" etc...\n\nWe can't afford private school, but there are other school systems I'm looking into, and I have years to decide, I just want to be informed is all. \n\nThanks for everyone's input, I greatly appreciate it!", "Sub-Reddit": "r_parenting", "Model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "It's understandable that the narrator is considering home-schooling their daughter, as they want her to have a better experience than they did in public schools.

You can try to find a solution to the diaper rash by using a different brand of diaper wipes or changing your daughter's diet.

People watched as if they pitied me while I struggled to stack the carseat on the suitcase while holding a sqwirmy baby.\n\nI blew off the looks and masterfuly maneuvered baby and luggage to the cart check-out (which don't have baby seats in them) to check one out and make the tow to the parking garage easier.

Halfway across a street the carseat falls off the suitcase. Again, looks of pity but no offer to help!

{"Reddit ID": "ee559", "Reddit Post": "Hello all - my husband and I have been trying to figure out if the amount of attention we get in public with our little girl is normal.  She's 8 months old and as cute as can be.  The thing is - we get a LOT of attention when we go out with her.  Is this normal?  She's our first, and I was in no way prepared for the number of people who would stop us, want to see her, want to take pictures of her, want to ooohh and ahhh over her all the time.  \n\nI'm sure as she gets a little older, this will decrease.  It was flattering at first, but it's beginning to be a bit of a hassle sometimes.  For example, I took her to Chipotle for lunch today.  While I ate (20 minutes) nine different people came up to me to talk about her.  It made it really hard to finish my meal.  At the same time, I noticed that another baby in the restaurant who was around the same age didn't get any of this attention.  \n\nSo, parents of reddit, is this a reasonable amount of attention to expect when taking a baby out in public?  And how to you manage to get done with your activities when people keep stopping you?  And, most importantly, how do you protect the baby from these well-meaning strangers' germs during cold and flu season?", "Sub-Reddit": "r_parenting", "Model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "It's normal for babies to receive a lot of attention when they're out in public, especially if they're cute and well-behaved.

You can also bring along a book or a toy to distract your little one while you eat or do other tasks.\n\nWhen it comes to protecting your baby from germs during cold and flu season, it's important to take precautions such as washing your hands frequently, covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, and avoiding close contact with sick people. You can also consider using hand sanitizer or disinfecting wipes on surfaces that your baby may touch.\n\nOverall, while it's important to be mindful of your baby's health and safety, try not to stress too much about the attention you receive in public.

{"Reddit ID": "offdq", "Reddit Post": "My two year old is a very advanced speaker. While he got a late start, he speaks in full sentences, uses pronouns, and has no 'r' or 's' or 'l' problems.

For example, if I say something wrong, or he doesn't agree with me, instead of \"no, daddy\", it becomes \"no no no daddy\". It's not just \"no\", either. Sometimes he repeats a word once, sometimes it'll be like 7 times before he can spit out the rest of the sentence.

I'll try to make it short.\n\nBasically he is pissed at me because of some legal stuff between his mom and myself (we've been apart for 10+ years). He started off by not wanting to come to my house for my parenting time. So, like an freakin' idiot trying to be a cool dad I let it slide. 10 weeks later he stomping his foot and still saying that I can't make him come over. I'm supposed to have him every weekend and haven't seen him for 2 1/2 months. During that time we were trying to do counseling (he and I) to get it worked out. After 3 sessions he stomped his foot again and refused to go.\n\nSoooo, I finally laid down the law - literally. Told him I was picking him up this Friday and that was that. He stomped his foot and said \"you can't make me\", but it turns out that \"YEAH I CAN\". So i told him that and also how I was going to do it. It involves the police and a neat little thing called a Civil Standby (Civil Assist).\n\nHence the \" I hate you!!!\"\n\nIt's a bit more complicated than that, but does that help clear it up?\n\n\n\n**Second Edit:\n\nThe worst part is that he really is a great kid.

We usually give him 6oz in a bottle, and this bottle was full almost to the brim. This is a [Playtex DropIn](http://playtexbaby.com/Bottles/Dropins/Premium-Nurser) bottle, FYI. \n\nSo I call up the day care and ask them what the deal is, this is much more than 6oz of formula. They tell me that they premix the formula, measure it in a separate measuring cup, and then pour 6oz of formula solution in the bottle. This confounds me, so I do a little experiment of my own. I grab my own measuring cup, fill it with 6oz of water, and pour it into the bottle.

This past year has been upsetting to her, though.\n\nUp until about a year ago she spent her days with her grandparents. Then they left the country for a while, and she started daycare, which she enjoyed... she had no issues being away from us all day. Her grandparents came back in February, and at the same time, her little brother was born. She went back to staying with the grandparents during the day for the whole spring; then in the summer, grandparents had to leave again.

But if someone has to step out unexpectedly, she breaks down.\n\nLast night grandma had to run an errand.

Not just off our bed, but from bed to the wooden platform (6 inches), then from the platform to the floor (5-6 inches).\n\n* I had laid him in the center of the bed and turned around to grab his shirt. My back was turned for, perhaps, two seconds. Yet he managed to roll off the bed.\n\n* He landed on his belly.\n\n* He started howling immediately.\n\n* I immediately picked him up and soothed him. After ten or fifteen seconds, he calmed right down. Breastfed just fine. Was laughing and smiling before bed.\n\n* We did a pupil dilation check with a flashlight several times yesterday and today and he seemed normal. Rotated his limbs and checked for any swelling or sensitivity. All was fine. Sleep was normal.\n\nHow long do I need to be terrified? How can I tell if this has retarded my kid? Can a concussion take awhile to take effect? And are there any additional checks I should run within the next 72 hours that may not be found on pediatric websites?\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the great info. Feel better now.

If any part of the issue is in your control, break down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect. If you feel overwhelmed, look for support from friends/family. Focus on the accomplishments and feel empowered as you strike off items from your to-do list. Re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process as needed. Additionally, it may be helpful to ask the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not. In situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others\u2019 perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint.

We used to try home-teaching with no results. He was accepted into a special abilitation center, so we are handling it more or less. We will make further decisions once we have a more extended diagnosis.    \nI am having major concerns for my middle kid - 3 years old. He is also severally language challenged, only likes to mimic some animals and other sounds sporadically and a few main words on a rare occasion. I believe I saw a disappointing sign  this evening. He is able to handle undressing as well as putting on some of the clothing. I gave him pajama pants to putt on by himself. While some direction was required how to hold them, he put both legs into one hole and did not try to fix that problem by himself.  \nI am wondering if this type of nearsightedness is a sign of Autism or it is the same with regular kids?

Maybe he's more afraid of going upstairs alone at night time (not necessarily afraid of the dark), or maybe he's more afraid of just being alone upstairs. I have to sit on the bed with him while he sleeps (putting him to sleep), and then I can safely walk away safely after he has fallen asleep completely. If I walk away 2 minutes into putting him to sleep, while he hasn't fallen asleep yet, he'll tell me 'please stay', almost begging me to stay. If I tell him to go up and sleep by himself, he refuses. If he stays up late downstairs, then he might just fall asleep on the sofa. This is becoming a headache and it wastes about 20-30 mins of my time every night while putting him to sleep.\n\nIt's been like this for years, I just figured one day he'll say 'ok I'm ready to do this on my own'.
