Even after the event has happened, and been wrapped up, I still can't shake the anger caused by the situation for a few days. \n\nI am wondering if there are people who have similar issues, and what ways you have found to let go of the residual anger/cope? \n\nIt seems so absurd intellectually to still hold onto things, but I still can't shake it. \n\nFor context, my biggest trigger in the world is Dog urine or feces in my house. My boyfriend absolutely loves dogs and got a Beagle about 6 mos. ago. I on the other hand could do without ever seeing a dog again, but I put up with them. My one condition was that she be potty trained. She is potty trained, however, she is scared of literally EVERYTHING and also doesn't like me, so when he is gone she gets anxious and any loud noise or sudden movement has her peeing, trembling, whining, teeth chattering, the whole nine yards. She has even peed on my pillow in my bed before. It sends me through the roof, so much so that I need to leave so that I do not become violent. The thing that sucks is that other than her noise phobia, peeing, and separation anxiety from my bf, she is a very sweet and well trained dog. Her and I just do not get along, especially when she pees out of fear. \nBUT I hold onto the anger of wanting to just beat the hell out of her for days.

It's small things that really shouldn't upset anyone as much as it does me. My girlfriend not washing a dish, puppy playing with my other dog and making noise, and most small inconveniences seem to fire me up immensely. I do my best to not take it out on anyone or the dogs because I know it's not right but I am slipping. I know she can tell I am having a hard time and I know it is hard on her as well. I'd really like to start seeing a therapist but I do not know how to even go about doing that. I know part of my problem is a lack of release. I've spent the better part of my life gaming, but I just don't enjoy it anymore and it seems to just make me more angry. I've been trying different things like being more active with my dogs and building legos (which does help a lot actually but the sets are expensive so it's a momentary release).

Given the narrator's frustration with themselves and their performance, it may be helpful for them to also seek professional support, such as therapy or counseling, to help them process their emotions and develop coping strategies. The narrator seems to have a mixed ability to cope emotionally with the consequences of their actions, which suggests that they may need additional support and guidance to fully manage their emotions and behavior.

It's also important for the narrator to recognize that their partner may not always be able to meet their needs or expectations, and that it's important to find ways to adapt and compromise. By doing so, the narrator can potentially break the cycle of frustration and anger and improve their relationship with their partner. It's also important for the narrator to recognize that their personal values may not align with their partner's behavior, and that it's important to communicate their concerns in a respectful manner.

{"Reddit ID": "Anger_62", "Reddit Post": "The past few days have been tense in my house with my family (results of 6+ months inside the house with them). As a result, I've basically managed to take my anger out on projects (scale models) I've done for school and completely annihilate them by throwing and stomping them. I've also been walking my dog and smiling and waving at other dog walkers, who in return don't wave back. This causes an immediate rise in anger level and I basically give myself the impression that i'm giving them a death stare, and i start to realize that after it's too late. The latter incidents have me worried i'll eventually do something stupid if I don't catch myself. I'm mad at myself as what i've written seems to paints me as a petulant child, but it's reality.

So lo and behold, i check my mailbox and see a \"sorry we missed you\" notice. I was home ALL DAY and the package was an amazon package which does not require a signature and they refused to deliver it to my door.\n\nI had to go to the post office to pick it up. When I get there I tell the lady and ask why I'm here essentially why can't they just deliver to my fucking door. She says that it'd take the workers too long to do that because our complex gets so many packages. I'm soo annoyed. I feel inconvenienced because of the drive there and how absolutely unnecessary this is. It's like the residents are being punished because we order packages. Ridiculous. This always happens when I'm inconvenienced and know that others are in the wrong. I get even more pissed because I try to do the right thing when it comes to others and feel the lack of communication between my apartment managers and the USPS shows complete disregard for the residents.

It doesn't happen too often since I usually take my clothes out and fold them before she even notices I did laundry, but I forget every once in a while and every time it makes my day a bit worse. I told her today that I don't care if it's 4am and I'm asleep, I want her to at least warn me that she's going to touch my clothes if I don't get up right away. \n\nI went back to my room after taking my clothes and I wanted to scream but I always manage to stop myself by just pretending to yell and by punching my mattress and pillows.

Personally I would never even consider expecting someone else to cook my breakfast but I guess she was?\n\nUsually what I do when something like this happens is leave the room and/or listen to white noise and continue what I was doing to try and drown out her yelling, which is one of the sounds that I'm sensitive to from being autistic.

I want to be on good terms with them because I don't want something bad to happen. This is really affecting my ability to dispel my anger and deal with it in a normal way. I have always noticed that I feel guilt when I get angry at my family, but this time it has been full force. I've even been getting migraines because of how stressed out I have been over this.

I hate myself for my anger issues, I feel like I got them from my father, I'm pretty sure he has bipolar and I feel I've inherited that from him, I watched him and my older brother always be angry and learned from them, and it always got worse as I got older, and now my anger issues are so bad. I don't know what to do or how to help them, I try to stay calm and talk with people but they get so exhausting honestly, and it's why I'd rather be alone. I hate myself truly, I'm becoming my father. He only gets mad and yells at us when we're at home, but when he's in front of people in public he can control it somehow. I'm becoming the same way I think. I try to stay calm with people in public and not freak out on them, but with my family I just snap sometimes. I always feel awful afterwards and I try to convince myself to calm down and talk it out and think before acting, and I feel sincere and I just wanna apologize every time I yell at someone or have a pissy tone with them. I mean I guess I'm different from my father there, my father never admits he's wrong or sincere or sorry for anything he does, where as I do, I'm sorry for everything I do wrong. I spend hours bashing myself for every little thing I do wrong, when it comes to yelling or anything. I just don't know what to do about my anger issues. Any suggestions?

I had anger issues in kindergarten and in elementary school and have been to a psychologist in second grade because my situation was that bad. Nowadays, the issues are much worse, I have lots of stress on me currently with online school and all kinds of things related to it, I am very tired because I am also not getting enough sleep.\n\nWhenever I get angry, I usually just have to smash whatever it is in my hand (controller, pen, notebook etc) against the surface that is closest to me, let it be my desk or bed. This has not only caused me and my family hundreds of dollars of damages, but I also usually get hurt in the process. Sure, wounds can heal, but having them in the first place because of a mental breakdown because my pen has dried out is a pretty fucked up thing in my book. \n\nI tried putting said things down before starting to hit something, but I just have zero self control and can't consistently do so. I also tried calming myself down by just staying still and doing nothing, but that usually gets me even more angry and I cause more harm to myself. I tried hitting other things like my pillows, but that causes almost the same effect as staying still. And after I break something I get sober and realize what I just did and get a bad feeling of doom or whatever that is.\n\nIs there any way I can at the very least minimize these breakouts?

I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, \"oh hes not that,\" and move on.

However, the narrator's ability to cope with the situation during the driving test suggests that they were able to manage their anxiety to some extent, and that they may have been able to cope with the consequences of the event to a greater extent than they initially thought.

I haven't really talked to her for 2 years, so I am thinking that I would come off as a creep if I were to talk to her. And she typically walks at a 4mph rate, with arms crossed, looking down, so I don't really know if randomly saying hello would come off as weird or not, or if she doesn't even see me.

While the narrator may not have complete control over the situation, they can still take steps to manage their emotions and make informed decisions about their relationships.

The narrator also mentions that they have been diagnosed with severe anxiety, and this situation is exacerbating their symptoms.

This is my first time posting on here. I will be 19 in two days, I have been struggling with anxiety, and depression for about three years now, at least that's when it got really bad. I panic through out all day almost every day about every little thing and I am in bed all day every day, too scared to stay standing up for longer than going to get food or to the bathroom before I run back to my bed. This has gotten so bad I'm unable to work, socialize with friends and family, or do something as simple as take my dog for a walk. I am barely holding on and I can't handle much more of this. I was prescribed Cipralex a few months ago and I only took that for a few days because medication is one of the many things that give me anxiety, and than I search every little thing and scare myself into even feeling sick. Today I was prescribed sertraline, and I even went to pick it up and it's in my medicine cabinet now. I read up on this medication for so long and I'm so scared to start it not knowing what to expect, so I guess I'm just looking for advice and to hear other peoples stories and hopefully gain some motivation and courage to start this medication that could potentially change my life.

I'm under a tremendous amount of pressure to get very high grades (straight A's). I've completed 2 exams, and have 5 left to go, 3 of which I'll be sitting tomorrow, the next day, and the day after that...\n\nI'm shocked at how this stress has effected me physically. I've always been fairly neurotic, but the anxiety I tend to feel is transient, and is rarely severe enough to manifest in anything physically significant, beyond a raised pulse and slight breathlessness.\n\nI knew I was getting myself *way* too worked up when I started to pull out hair in the shower. I have very thick hair, so a lot of it was coming out. I've had severe brain fog, which hasn't been the least bit helpful during a time when I have to be the most alert and *with it*'. I've had no appetite, and now my trousers are all loose, with one  pair literally falling down when I walk. The most bizarre symptom I've had is this weird jaw tension - my jaw is very clicky, and it feels incredibly tense and stiff. As a hypochondriac, I was convinced this was a heart attack, but I was reassured that it's probably just anxiety. I've had weird gastrointestinal symptoms, where I feel nauseous, and have this pit in my stomach all of the time, which could be caused by the lack of eating, but it persists even when I have eaten. \n\nAnd then of course feelings of impending doom, etc etc. \n\nI just can't wait for this to be over.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_anxiety", "Model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "<likert>8</likert><rationale>It's important for the narrator to recognize that their stress and anxiety are not solely their responsibility.

Even with anxiety medicine, I still struggle with anxiety and because of it, depression. My anxiety medicine seems to have bad side effects, like no sex drive, super irregular periods, tiredness, night sweats. I would say it slightly helps but I also wonder sometimes if it is just a placebo affect in my mind.\n\n I struggle to work, be social or anything \"normal\" people do. The longest I have had a job was 7 months straight before I quit and changed jobs. I am a hard worker when my anxiety doesn't get the best of me and I have excelled in any job I have done. I've even excelled in school and just got my Associates degree. Now I am incredibly anxious because I need to get a job again now that I completed school but all I can think of is how anxious it makes me.

We have lived together and always been around each other since we started dating . So why I'm the hell do I still get anxiety when they call us and ask us to dinner or to come over? Sometimes I can do it with no problems. But other times I feel like I'm going to throw up. Even when I know I'm hungry. It sucks so bad. I know that sometimes I can do it with no problems but the fact that I still have to think about and not just do it really irks me. I just want to be normal.

It's also important to remember that it's okay to not have everything to talk about, and that sometimes the best conversations are the ones where you're both just enjoying each other's company. Don't be too hard on yourself if things don't go perfectly - socializing is a skill that takes practice, and everyone has to start somewhere. Additionally, it's important to remember that it's okay to make mistakes and that it's a natural part of the learning process. Don't be afraid to ask for help or feedback if you need it.</rationale>", "evaluation_raw_output_dim_23": "Yes"}

I started my current position in august but have called out/left early several times due to the fact that my anxiety makes me physically ill. (Heart rate above 150 and uncontrollable throwing up) making it impossible for me to be in a public environment. This past Thursday I received a very unexpected call that my grandmother who I was very close to was on life support and it was critical that we needed to go see her that day. Friday I asked to stay off with her again due to the fact she was going to be removed from life support and was not expected to make it. Thinking about going in tomorrow is making me sick. Her funeral will not be until Thursday and I know I cannot be in the environment for the next three days while I am grieving. But I feel as if I have already taken too much time and I need my job to pay my bills. Not to mention I am getting married in May and require two weeks off for travel. I guess I just need some advice. Not really sure what is best to do here.

New poster so I apologize for any mistakes! \n\nI've been dealing with anxiety and panic attacks since I was in middle school, and I know that they are caused by abandonment issues, as well as some insecurities. I know exactly what my triggers are, why they happen and what specific fear is causing them....so for the most part I have been able to manage it without medication or therapy. Unfortunately, things began to peak two years ago during the beginning of covid and my stress and anxiety ended up actually causing shingles. After this, and getting covid, a few other random symptoms began to occur during major anxiety episodes. These still happen to this day, when it gets bad enough, but doctors have assured me these symptoms are my \"post covid norm now\". A lot happened in that time to cause it, so it wasn't one specific trigger like it used to be. Ever since, I have had a much more difficult time controlling the spiraling that occurs once the thoughts creep in. It is now affecting my personal relationships as well. \n\nMy question is, how are you able to manage the physical and emotional symptoms of anxiety when a major episode does occur?

{"Reddit ID": "Anxiety_111", "Reddit Post": "Just wanted to share with someone that I filed my tax return all on my own!\n\nFor those outside England a quick simplified brief on our tax system.  If you work for an employer they normally work out how much tax etc you owe and it's deducted at source so what you get in your pay check is yours. But if you're self employed you have to fill in a tax return each year. You can fill in the return from the 6th April and it has to be done by 31st January the following year. So the tax return I've just submitted is for tax year 2020-2021.\n\nI hate doing my tax return. My accounts are really simple, profits easy to calculate and very few expenses. But I'm so paranoid I'll do something wrong. There's so many different fields to fill in and I have no clue what half of them mean. I've always asked my sister to sit with me in the past when I do my returns but this year I did it all on my own.\n\nTo further complicate matters my accounts last year are screwed up because of coronavirus. My income was down ~75% but I was eligible for a government support scheme called the Self Employment Income Support Scheme. However I then had to declare all these figures on my tax returns which was even more boxes to tick.\n\nI also had to claim my fifth grant which means working out my turnover for the last two years etc. and freaking out that I'll somehow claim the wrong amount or screw something up.\n\nIt took me two weeks of staring at the folder to build up the courage and then about half an hour ago I finally hit that sweet spot of the anxiety of not doing it outweighing the anxiety of doing it (the grant deadline is September). So here I am just after midnight waiting for the anxiety adrenaline rush to die down so I can actually get some sleep.\n\nBut I did it!

{"Reddit ID": "o7lkru", "Reddit Post": "Recently, the Israeli government reinstituted its indoor mask mandate after about 300 Israelis were diagnosed with COVID-19. As a result, many people are fearing that COVID-19 restrictions will be constantly looming over us for the rest of human history, persistently drifting in and out of our lives. I'd like to explain why these fears simply are not rational. Despite what some say, Israel has not achieved herd immunity. They are very close, of course, but they are not at that milestone *yet.* About 5,160,000 Israelis are fully vaccinated, equivalent to roughly 56% of the Israeli population is fully vaccinated. Add that to all the Israelis who have attained natural immunity from the virus, and the percentage rate of immunity within Israel arrives at roughly 66%. For a group to have herd immunity to COVID-19, 70% must be immune. Because Israel has yet to achieve herd immunity, it is still possible for an outbreak to take place. Even with this in mind, the outbreak Israel has been facing is minuscule compared to the size of outbreaks at any point in 2020.

After the third and a half week or so, I felt well enough to put in a full workout. I did so, and 48 hours later, my Covid symptoms had returned in pretty much full force. I've read about different forms \"long Covid\" takes - it's not always persistent - some report reinfection or reactivation of Covid after periods of dormancy. Two weeks after my initial reactivation, my symptoms begin to subside. I decide to get the first Covid vaccine (I read that in some \"vaccine vanguard\" countries like Israel, they were recommending one covid shot for those who had already had the virus). I get the first shot, and feel a little not great for about 48 hours or so (mild discomfort in lymph nodes, some fatigue, weakness), but afterwards I begin to feel great, better than I had at any point since before I got Covid in early May. A week ago I put in a full exercise. About 24 hours later, I don't feel like I felt when I had Covid, but I definitely feel the exact same as I did *after* I had gotten my first shot - mild discomfort in lymph nodes, some weakness. I am under the impression working out a second time \"reactivated\" dormant Covid, but the vaccine kicked back in and enlisted my immune system in fighting this second activation. Finding information about the virus at this time has been so frustrating - official counsel has lagged internet anecdotes and similar by a considerable amount of time.

{"Reddit ID": "o93rqd", "Reddit Post": "Hey, everyone, just in a particularly dark patch, and feeling the need for some dialogue. I've been doing a lot of thinking, lately, and I think I've finally got a handle on why the pandemic has been so chronically stressful for me, and others, over the past year. Specifically those in first world countries, in relation to how it affects us on a psychological level. As people, we tend to experience bad things as happening suddenly, all at once, and then you deal with them. A broken leg, a car wreak, getting fired, getting dumped, etc. Deeply unpleasant, but relatively short-duration things. These are type-1 and type-2 problems; Things which can be avoided, or which can be fixed. But the Coronavirus has loaded us all down with the third type of problem. The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part. Lots of us weren't doing too great before the pandemic hit, but then, after 15 months of slow, grinding lockdowns, endless bad news on top of bad news, and nowhere to go to get away from it... Is it really a wonder why everyone is so unhappy all the time? I feel like a machine that's trying harder and harder to run without lubricant, to the point that it's just scraping metal-on-metal, and every day is a bit harder than the last.

The narrator seems to be struggling with the emotional consequences of the pandemic and feels overwhelmed by the expectations of others. They express frustration and exhaustion in having to constantly explain their feelings and decisions. While they may have some coping mechanisms in place, such as distancing themselves from the problem by being busy or avoiding certain situations, it is clear that they are not fully able to cope with the situation. Therefore, I would rate their emotional coping as a 5 out of 9. However, the narrator also seems to have a moderate level of control over the situation. They are able to make decisions about what they feel comfortable doing and communicating their concerns to others, but they also acknowledge that they are not able to control the behavior of others or the overall pandemic situation. The narrator seems to be aware of the limitations of their control and is taking steps to protect themselves while still allowing for some level", "evaluation_raw_output_dim_23": "Minor Error"}

Additionally, the narrator should consider the potential impact of their actions on others, particularly those who may be more vulnerable to the virus. It is important for the narrator to prioritize the health and safety of others, even if they themselves are not at risk. The narrator's belief that the WHO has some level of control over the situation suggests that they may have some level of trust in the organization's expertise, but it is important for the narrator to recognize that the Delta variant is a complex issue and that there may be limitations to the WHO's ability to control the situation. It is important for the narrator to stay informed about the latest developments and to take precautions to protect themselves and others.

I (22f) got my first shot of Biontech last week and so did my sister. My mom is fully vaccinated with Moderna. My stepdad received his first shot of Biontech two days ago. But we also have two kids (age 5 and 3) in our family. Obviously they can't get vaccinated. Hearing that Delta is very transmissible, and often even infects vaccinated folk, scares me. I know efficiency of the vaccines was never 100% but I believed at least we'd be safe from Covid when we get vaccinated. I work full-time and go to school. At school, everyone wears a mask, we are 1,5m apart, the windows are open and everyone gets tested daily. At work, my coworker wears a mask and so do I. When I eat or drink I go outside. Otherwise, I don't take off my mask at all (I wear FFP2 or FFP3). My boss doesn't wear a mask but he only occasionally comes into our office. Also, everyone at my work place had Corona three months ago except me. They caught Alpha (B117). I also have to take public transit. Everyone wears masks. Windows are open. How big is my risk of infection? I have been getting regularly tested since March 21 (1 to 4 times a week) and it came back negative all the time, even when we had a high national incidence and infection was more likely. National incidence is now 5 cases per 100.000 people. In my town it is 3 cases per 100.000 people. At the moment, we have 49 active cases (my town is huge; 500.000 people live here). Do I really have to be worried? I even wear my ffp2 mask when I walk my dog. When I am fully vaccinated, what safety measures should I still follow?

First my elderly grandparents for being high risk, then my best friend who had her baby very premature, then my mum was bedridden for months due to covid, and now my dad has cancer and has to have chemo. It has been almost a full year since I saw a single family member, more than a year for many of them. And not even a glimmer of hope. I am fully vaccinated even, and I am watching people here happy about losing restrictions, but I am so scared of losing someone after being away for so long and it's getting more and more overwhelming.

FWIW, I also live thousands of miles from all of my family. My anxiety got pretty bad several months ago during the holidays when Covid was at its peak and was impossible to see people.

During that time it got so bad that I drove thousands of miles to be with relatives. I was able to spend time with them in the evenings which was really helpful and eventually I felt back to normal for the most part. Since then Ive also gotten my job back. However, during the last month Ive gone through a breakup of sorts and that has brought my anxiety back. I lived alone for several years before this and it used to be awesome for me but now it just feels painful. Im almost afraid of being alone. My anxiety is always bad in the mornings; I dont get a lot of sleep because of it which makes it difficult to focus at work. Also, my anxiety gives me get bad stomach aches and I lose my appetite so it makes it really hard to eat. I usually have to force myself to eat every day which just isnt fun. My work is partially opened up and Ive been trying to go in at least a few hours a day just to be around other humans. That helps for sure. Ive been trying to take early morning bike rides as soon as I get up and that typically helps but in the few hours before work starts, Im still rather anxious. Ive tried meditating (which kinda makes things worse), journaling, watching mindless TV, reaching out to friends, etc. I talk to a therapist on a weekly basis which has been helpful. I tried antidepressants (SSRIs) for about 6 months or so and they made my anxiety worse at first and I didnt feel like they were super helpful after that.

My wife and I are moving to the UK from South Korea this month and are in a tight position regarding vaccination - we could technically get our first jab in Korea but dont have enough time to get both. We have been struggling to decide on what to do for two reasons. 1) is it even possible to get to the UK and say hey I have already got one jab from maker X so please just give me the second one 2) would it be possible to get a vaccine passport like this? I fear that with countries not recognizing vaccination abroad we would be stuck in this limbo of not being believed by either the UK or South Korea Anyone has a similar experience?

Before I got vaccinated, I was in constant in fear of dying, spreading it to someone high risk, or my family getting sick/dying. My immediate family knows that I suffer with it, but no one aside from my brother really understands the levity of how crippling it can be. I barely leave the house cuz of it now and have to put ointment on my skin because I've been oversanitizing/overwashing to the point where my skin bleeds and cracks. My immediate family isn't against COVID safety by any means, but they definitely make me feel crazy for still wanting to disinfect everything and everything else. The family that's coming hasn't been the safest during COVID. They're now all fully vaccinated, but I'm extremely anxious to be around them and that some freak outbreak could happen between us. I'm trying to set boundaries and minimize exposure, but knowing my family, feeling the weight of their judgment will also give me immense anxiety. Part of me doesn't want to really go to this family event, but my mom keeps reassuring me that it's only our family and no one else (even though that's like 30 people). I also have a rocky relationship with religion due to being queer so being in a church setting to begin with is really hard for me.

Well she's my friend as well since I know her since I was little because her son is one of my best friends growing up. There will probably be 50ish guests there (don't know exactly, could be more). It is planned to be a garden party but forecast says rain, so it's probably indoors. It's in my hometown, so I would need to travel there a few hours to attend. I haven't seen many of the people attending there since last year including some of my friends. Mainly because I didn't want to meet because of the virus. I only texted with them. Cases are very low (sometimes zero) there. Some people there are fully vaccinated, some got their 1st shot and some haven't yet. I got my first shot 3 weeks ago(Moderna). I haven't met such a big group since last summer. Only smaller groups and always outdoors. You can probably tell by now that I'm a very careful person when it comes to dealing with the virus. I always followed my principles. Right know I'm going back and fourth whether I should go or not. Is it still okay to apply the precautionary principle here and not attend? I mean I'm 3 weeks out from being fully vaccinated. Everyone else there is in a spirit to party because we couldn't for so long. I'm not having that feeling. Quite the opposite.

{"Reddit ID": "og9qaf", "Reddit Post": "Hi everyone - thank you for the support shown in this forum. Since March 2020, I've been in a COVID bubble with my wife, sister-in-law, and their parents. While the last year and a half have been trying emotionally and professionally for all of us, things are looking up with the vaccine. However, my wife's parents refuse to get vaccinated. They are not in great health and my father-in-law specifically is older and I worry about his health. Therefore, even as things have started to open up, my family has been relatively more conservative, with no masks-free indoor interaction outside of the family, even with people that are vaccinated, for fear of spreading the virus to my inlaws. This is becoming a big problem because I am building a startup and my cofounder is someone I met during the pandemic. He and I need to start building a more regular working cadence and relationship, but this is really difficult since my wife and SIL are not comfortable with me working in person with him, even though he is vaccinated (though he is much less careful than us). For my part, I would like to push the company forward, and agree that our creative work would improve if we were able to work in-person a couple of times per week. I'm just at a loss - my wife is grieving what she perceives as the loss of her parents' sanity and doesn't want to cut them off, but I face real professional challenges (let alone the ongoing personal and mental health challenges) from continuing the status quo. Guiltily, I feel very angry at them - I feel like they are offloading responsibility for their safety on my wife, SIL, and myself, which seems extremely selfish.

{"Reddit ID": "oga1in", "Reddit Post": "This lockdown has gone on forever. From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to. I feel like I've become so negative that I don't want to share my thoughts with people because I will bring them down, and I already feel like I pushed some people away by doing this. I emailed multiple psychiatrists, but only one answered me and had one short appointment, and told me I should continue looking because he doesn't have time for new patients. I spend most of my time trying to get the motivation to work but failing, and looking at vaccination percentages and restrictions around the world hoping to see them improve and thinking about where else can be better than here.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_covid19_support", "Model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "<likert>6</likert><rationale>It's important for the narrator to recognize that they are not solely responsible for the situation and that the pandemic is a global issue.

I'm a 19 year old autistic Italian boy, but despite being on the spectrum right before the pandemic started I've had a big progress at socializing with people, I hung out with big groups among my friends every Saturday night, we had so much fun, and then the pandemic happened. My group not only shut down for months, but the general spirit of the group kept going downhill, i tried helping them but ended up feeling just as bad as them if not worse. After a painful year of online class (which i could barely even do cus my wifi had given up on me), I thankfully was able to get even both shots of the Moderna vaccine. But even after all that, the group hasn't changed. Whenever someone asks to go out, we get the same answers like \"i can't, i need to study/work\", \"I'll be there next weeks (it's the 4th time they said that) and the spirit is still doom and gloom. I want to find some other friends, but due to how stuck to their circles people are here I'm afraid I'll never be able to find someone else who likes me. What can i do which can help me?

We've spoken to the councilors an given them as much background as we can. The question came up of whether or not to be up front with the other kids - for example, on the first day reading them a book about Aspergers ([maybe this one](http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1843102064/ref=oss_product) ). This could be done in the context of each kid telling something unique about them self. My son is very open Aspergers, and would have no problem doing that. \n\nPeople on the \"against\" side, have concerns that it would be singling him out and may cause more problems and teasing.\n\nPeople on the \"for\" side point out that the kids will pick up fairly quickly that my son is \"different\" and being up-front about what that difference is and how they could help could prevent problems. Also, they point out that if a child had a physical disability you would certainly talk about it, e.g.  \"Billy has a XXX so he would be able to go swimming with us, but he loves to sit on deck and you can still play ball with him that way\".\n\nSo what do you think?", "Sub-Reddit": "r_parenting", "Model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "<likert>5</likert><rationale>It is important for the narrator to consider the potential consequences of disclosing their son's Aspergers to the other kids.

{"Reddit ID": "ldud2", "Reddit Post": "So, I'm doing some soul searching about my motorcycle.  I've ridden for six years, and have about 100,000 miles under my belt.  I've always been extremely responsible, I've worn all the gear, all the time, gotten the training, and obey traffic laws.  My wife, bless her, has never pressured me to leave them behind.  In fact she pressures the exact opposite since she doesn't want to hear me gripe about not having a bike.\n\nMy son is thirteen months old.  Every time I leave on the bike I make sure the last thing I say to him, and my wife is that I love them.  A small part of this is too ensure that if I'm on the bike and my number comes up, the last thing I've said to them is the most important thing that needs to be said.\n\nI don't think I can do this anymore.  Today, while riding, I just couldn't stop thinking about how absurd my little ritual is since I'm actually out there doing something that increases the likely hood that my innocent \"I love you\" really will the last thing they hear me say.\n\nSo, I'm curious how other bikers dealt with this.  Did you give it up? Do you regret it?  I can't help but feel like the pang of regret I might feel on a sunny day with no bike would probably be outweighed with a satisfied feeling of duty to my family.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_parenting", "Model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "<likert>8</likert><rationale>It's understandable that the narrator feels a sense of responsibility for their actions and wants to ensure that their family knows how much they love them.

Does it interfere with your work and life too much? Is it possible to do both 1/2 public and 1/2 home somehow?\n\nEdit: I guess I should clarify- I no way intend to keep my daughter out of social activities, I would most likely have her attend a home-schooling co-op should my decision sway this way. I would also have tutors come over and help her in the areas I have trouble with (math...) so that she doesn't struggle her way through college or group projects. Also, I know how home-schooling can be abused (and why that is one reason it is controversial), my partner and I are both very open minded, free-thinking people who love to explore all realms of ideologies and theories (in other words we aren't going to shove her in Jesus camp and tell her that everyone is evil and wrong except us), also I would have her attend summer camps or maybe join a club so that she would get plenty of social interaction not to mention give us both a brief break from one another (kids need space too!). \n\nI just want her to have a better experience than I did in public schools. I wish I'd learned what I know now back then (I guess we all do) but the classes I was offered were mostly test-prep and my teachers were very, how you say, \"Do what I say, don't ask questions, shut up sit down\" etc...\n\nWe can't afford private school, but there are other school systems I'm looking into, and I have years to decide, I just want to be informed is all. \n\nThanks for everyone's input, I greatly appreciate it!", "Sub-Reddit": "r_parenting", "Model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "<likert>5</likert><rationale>It's understandable that the narrator wants to provide their daughter with a better education than they had themselves.

Her doctor prescribed a roll-on type of gel to stop the sweating in her palms and feet, but it is such a hassle to use, we don't bother. You actually have to apply it before bedtime, then wrap the hands and feet in gauze, then cover with plastic. Wtf?\n\n\nEvery time I hold her hand sh'es embarrassed because her hands are soaking wet. When she does homework she has to get up and wash and dry her hands several times. It's very frustrating to her. She's worried she will never get to have a boyfriend, because every time she'll hold hands with him, her palms will be soaking wet. I feel terrible for her, and I have never known anyone personally who has this problem.\n\n\nAnyways, I understand there is a very minor, hardly invasive surgery available for this, wherein the doctor makes a small incision between two of the rids, and basically snips and cauterizes the nerve that triggers this sweating.

People watched as if they pitied me while I struggled to stack the carseat on the suitcase while holding a sqwirmy baby.\n\nI blew off the looks and masterfuly maneuvered baby and luggage to the cart check-out (which don't have baby seats in them) to check one out and make the tow to the parking garage easier. The carts cost 3$ so I dig through my backpack for my wallet, as luck would have it I didn't have enough 1s, but I had a 10 when the machine only accepted 1s and 5s. I set out to find someone to trade two 5s for my ten. No one, not even security would help. \n\nI eventually gave up on the cart and tried to navigate my luggage while wrestling my Christmas ham to sit still and hang on to my neck en route to the garage. Halfway across a street the carseat falls off the suitcase. Again, looks of pity but no offer to help!

She's 8 months old and as cute as can be.  The thing is - we get a LOT of attention when we go out with her.  Is this normal?  She's our first, and I was in no way prepared for the number of people who would stop us, want to see her, want to take pictures of her, want to ooohh and ahhh over her all the time.  \n\nI'm sure as she gets a little older, this will decrease.  It was flattering at first, but it's beginning to be a bit of a hassle sometimes.  For example, I took her to Chipotle for lunch today.  While I ate (20 minutes) nine different people came up to me to talk about her.  It made it really hard to finish my meal.  At the same time, I noticed that another baby in the restaurant who was around the same age didn't get any of this attention.  \n\nSo, parents of reddit, is this a reasonable amount of attention to expect when taking a baby out in public?

Therefore, the situation is not completely consistent with the narrator's personal values.</rationale>\n\nThe narrator's concerns about their mother's behavior are understandable, given the potential risks to the baby's safety. However, it is important to note that the narrator's personal values may not align with their mother's behavior. For example, if the narrator values independence and autonomy for their mother, they may not agree with her desire to live in a protective bubble with the baby. Additionally, if the narrator values open communication and honesty, they may not appreciate their mother's fear and anxiety about the situation.\n\nIt is important for the narrator to approach the situation with empathy and understanding, while also setting boundaries and communicating their own needs and values. They may need to have a difficult conversation with their mother about her behavior and seek professional help if necessary. It is also possible that the narrator's own anxiety and fear about the situation may be contributing to their mother's behavior, and seeking support from a therapist or support group for new parents may be helpful. Ultimately, the narrator should prioritize their own well-being and seek the support they need to navigate this challenging situation.", "evaluation_raw_output_dim_23": "No"}

Maybe he's more afraid of going upstairs alone at night time (not necessarily afraid of the dark), or maybe he's more afraid of just being alone upstairs. I have to sit on the bed with him while he sleeps (putting him to sleep), and then I can safely walk away safely after he has fallen asleep completely. If I walk away 2 minutes into putting him to sleep, while he hasn't fallen asleep yet, he'll tell me 'please stay', almost begging me to stay. If I tell him to go up and sleep by himself, he refuses. If he stays up late downstairs, then he might just fall asleep on the sofa. This is becoming a headache and it wastes about 20-30 mins of my time every night while putting him to sleep.\n\nIt's been like this for years, I just figured one day he'll say 'ok I'm ready to do this on my own'.

I do work, but im in the process of moving out of my sisters so EVERY cent i am making is going towards finding a new place while paying her for the time i am still here. I am not asking for money at all, but i am asking for any items for a baby girl that are in good condition.\n\nMy friend suggested this website on babycenter, so I was just giving it a try! lol\n\nI live in BIRIMINGHAM AL. i do have a walmart registry!\n\nThank you all for just reading this, God bless you all!", "Sub-Reddit": "r_parenting", "Model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "<likert>5</likert><rationale>The narrator acknowledges that they are not responsible for the situation and that they are taking steps to address it.
