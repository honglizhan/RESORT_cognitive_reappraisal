Even after the event has happened, and been wrapped up, I still can't shake the anger caused by the situation for a few days. \n\nI am wondering if there are people who have similar issues, and what ways you have found to let go of the residual anger/cope? \n\nIt seems so absurd intellectually to still hold onto things, but I still can't shake it. \n\nFor context, my biggest trigger in the world is Dog urine or feces in my house. My boyfriend absolutely loves dogs and got a Beagle about 6 mos. ago. I on the other hand could do without ever seeing a dog again, but I put up with them. My one condition was that she be potty trained. She is potty trained, however, she is scared of literally EVERYTHING and also doesn't like me, so when he is gone she gets anxious and any loud noise or sudden movement has her peeing, trembling, whining, teeth chattering, the whole nine yards. She has even peed on my pillow in my bed before. It sends me through the roof, so much so that I need to leave so that I do not become violent. The thing that sucks is that other than her noise phobia, peeing, and separation anxiety from my bf, she is a very sweet and well trained dog. Her and I just do not get along, especially when she pees out of fear. \nBUT I hold onto the anger of wanting to just beat the hell out of her for days.

Consult with a professional dog trainer or behaviorist to help you address the dog's noise phobia, separation anxiety, and inappropriate elimination.\n2. Provide a safe and comfortable space for the dog to reduce its anxiety, such as a crate or a quiet room.\n3.

I'm still really pissed right now typing this and have no idea how to feel better.\n\nMy apartment manager let us know that packages can no longer be delivered to the office- just our front doors.

So lo and behold, i check my mailbox and see a \"sorry we missed you\" notice. I was home ALL DAY and the package was an amazon package which does not require a signature and they refused to deliver it to my door.\n\nI had to go to the post office to pick it up. When I get there I tell the lady and ask why I'm here essentially why can't they just deliver to my fucking door. She says that it'd take the workers too long to do that because our complex gets so many packages. I'm soo annoyed. I feel inconvenienced because of the drive there and how absolutely unnecessary this is. It's like the residents are being punished because we order packages. Ridiculous. This always happens when I'm inconvenienced and know that others are in the wrong.

{"Reddit ID": "Anger_87", "Reddit Post": "I've had this issue for many years now. I get extremely angry and violent when my mom does things that I've asked her not to do, sometimes it involves other people but mostly my mom since I'm around her the most. I get that it might be a teenager thing but I desperately want to find a way to stop letting it take control over me because it's getting a bit debilitating. Even though I don't let her see my anger and I don't yell at her (since she can out-yell me and would probably send me to my dad's forever), I feel terrible for feeling this way toward the person that took care of me my entire life.\n\nThis morning, she was drying her clothes after I had just done laundry, so she took my clothes out of the dryer and put them into a hamper thing. I've asked her multiple times to let me know if she needs the machine when my clothes are still in there (since we tend to do our laundry at the same time for some reason) because I get irrationally mad when she touches my clothes. It doesn't happen too often since I usually take my clothes out and fold them before she even notices I did laundry, but I forget every once in a while and every time it makes my day a bit worse. I told her today that I don't care if it's 4am and I'm asleep, I want her to at least warn me that she's going to touch my clothes if I don't get up right away. \n\nI went back to my room after taking my clothes and I wanted to scream but I always manage to stop myself by just pretending to yell and by punching my mattress and pillows. This time I missed though and I punched my metal bed frame and now my knuckles and some fingers are bruised and aching pretty bad.

Instead, try engaging in some self-care activities that help you relax and manage your emotions, such as deep breathing, meditation, or exercise.\n3. Communicate your needs clearly: Instead of getting angry when your mom touches your clothes, try calmly and clearly communicating your needs to her. Let her know that you would prefer it if she asked for your permission before using your laundry, and explain how it makes you feel when she doesn't.\n4.

Personally I would never even consider expecting someone else to cook my breakfast but I guess she was?\n\nUsually what I do when something like this happens is leave the room and/or listen to white noise and continue what I was doing to try and drown out her yelling, which is one of the sounds that I'm sensitive to from being autistic.

We had been there for five hours already, and I got kind of bored of listening to people talk. It's not that they're boring, but for me, listening to people talk in a language that's not my native language is difficult after several hours. I guess I was turning my head a lot, trying to find an interesting conversation, when my aunt asked me \"does it embarrass you to look at people?\" With a smile on her face\n\nA couple of days later, we went to a party with mariachi. When we got there, my aunt said \"smile, look confident. Didn't your mother ever teach you that?\" With a smile on her face. An hour later, some people we knew arrived. After greeting them, we walked back to our table. I was ahead of my aunt, and I looked down for a split second. She said \"(my name), don't look down\". \n\nAnother time, we went to someone's house for dinner. The hostess asked me if I liked the town. I said yes. I wanted to elaborate, but I had food in my mouth. The subject had already changed when my aunt started looking at me in my peripheral vision. She then whispered \"come on\".", "Sub-Reddit": "r_anxiety", "Model": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "Based on the situations you described, it seems that your aunt may have been trying to help you improve your social skills and confidence in interacting with others.

I've done Klonopin and Xanan in the past and because it was incredibly addictive and I knew that the long-term damage in the brain would be irreversible I decided to quit.\\*\\*\n\nKlonopin gives me a mellow and sweet feeling, but in the next day I feel super depressed. And Xanax never did anything to me besides brutally kill my appetite.\n\nAmbien on the other hand... ignoring the part where we get crazy and do stuff that we will regret later, like texting an old crush and asking him on a date (yeah, I had the date... today, btw! oh well, it was fast)... so, what I was saying is that the good part of Ambien is that you feel some kind of freedom and a really peaceful state of mind.\n\nLSD gave me the closest to what I should feel to be the happiest... but only during the trip. But then there's a problem: you can never know what your next trip will be like. And from paradise I went to pure nightmare (ER and shit). So I don't feel like trying it again even microdosing - same goes for shrooms. And weed... yeah, it's pleasurable and shit, but I don't know how it would be if I use it in long term.\n\nI'm thinking more of a controlled substance for now, aimed for anxiety and is similar to what Ambien does. What do we have? I want to have my mind exactly like it is right now while I'm on Ambien: I feel that I can focus, study and the same time being super original e capable of relax whenever I can.

I have always been the type to not be able to eat when I was anxious. Everyone thought it was weird which only made it worse because I now I'm caring what people think about me. Fast forward and I'm now with my wife of 5 years. I'll have random episodes when I choke up and feel like gagging when I eat but I have NOTHING to be anxious about. I honestly only feel this way when we are going out to eat with her family. Or with some of my family that I don't see often. But I love her family. We have lived together and always been around each other since we started dating . So why I'm the hell do I still get anxiety when they call us and ask us to dinner or to come over? Sometimes I can do it with no problems. But other times I feel like I'm going to throw up. Even when I know I'm hungry. It sucks so bad. I know that sometimes I can do it with no problems but the fact that I still have to think about and not just do it really irks me. I just want to be normal. Go out to dinners/party's and just eat a bunch of food and have fun with everyone. I should note that when we are home by ourselves I eat like a pig.

Hello!\n\nI'm not really able to seek therapy for the moment, but I'm doing everything I can to help myself. I unfortunately ended up abusing substances for a period of time but I'm sober now and dealing with things a little better. I'm just looking to see if anyone can relate to my experience with anxiety.\n\nFor me, there is no particular thing I get anxious about, no particular situation. I'm fine with phone calls, public speaking, all the classics. \n\nI get anxious when I have to do tasks that may reflect on my ability, intelligence, or self-worth. I also get anxious when I have to do things to achieve something that I care about. The sad thing is that I'm a huge procrastinator due to that. Avoidance and procrastination are how I cope. The issue is that it branched out so much it affects almost every activity. Most of the time though there is no other thing I should be doing.

Instead of beating yourself up over not meeting your own high standards, try to offer yourself understanding and kindness. Remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes and that you are doing the best you can.\n\nAdditionally, you may find it helpful to challenge the negative self-talk that is driving your anxiety.

I am staying away from any sleep medications because I have IBS too and they irritate it. So, yes. That is pretty much it. I had a really bad anxiety attack because I was afraid of getting nightmares(I get them a lot) and now I can't get sleep at all. Also, I lost one of my earrings a few days ago and found it on the bed(must have fallen off while sleeping) so now I am irritated at myself for how irresponsible I am and how I didn't search properly. To top it off, I have an important exam in less than 6 days and I really want to score high. However, I am really afraid that I won't be able to wakeup at the time that I want to because I am not getting sleep. And of course, I can't start studying now because I am really sleep deprived.

Except some stronger tension in neck and upper spine, everything looks well.\n\nSo i assume, the issue i have is anxiety.\n\nMy anxiety attacks last sometimes 5-7 minutes, sometimes around 15 minutes. \n\nThey are not so strong i can fight them off without medications, probably because of the line of work iam in (talking to people, moving around town, i just cant avoid people and public at work).\n\nMy problem started when i did every administrative thing i had for my late father, and i never experienced any problems like this, so i am thinking it is connected somehow. \n\nCan you please help me, share tips, how long this will last?", "Sub-Reddit": "r_anxiety", "Model": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "Based on your account, it appears that your anxiety symptoms started after you completed your father's administrative tasks, and they are related to specific situations such as going somewhere and exiting your car.

{"Reddit ID": "Anxiety_111", "Reddit Post": "Just wanted to share with someone that I filed my tax return all on my own!\n\nFor those outside England a quick simplified brief on our tax system.  If you work for an employer they normally work out how much tax etc you owe and it's deducted at source so what you get in your pay check is yours. But if you're self employed you have to fill in a tax return each year. You can fill in the return from the 6th April and it has to be done by 31st January the following year. So the tax return I've just submitted is for tax year 2020-2021.\n\nI hate doing my tax return. My accounts are really simple, profits easy to calculate and very few expenses. But I'm so paranoid I'll do something wrong. There's so many different fields to fill in and I have no clue what half of them mean. I've always asked my sister to sit with me in the past when I do my returns but this year I did it all on my own.\n\nTo further complicate matters my accounts last year are screwed up because of coronavirus. My income was down ~75% but I was eligible for a government support scheme called the Self Employment Income Support Scheme. However I then had to declare all these figures on my tax returns which was even more boxes to tick.\n\nI also had to claim my fifth grant which means working out my turnover for the last two years etc. and freaking out that I'll somehow claim the wrong amount or screw something up.\n\nIt took me two weeks of staring at the folder to build up the courage and then about half an hour ago I finally hit that sweet spot of the anxiety of not doing it outweighing the anxiety of doing it (the grant deadline is September).

Embrace your uniqueness: Everyone has their own way of communicating, and there's no one \"right\" way to do it.

I've been doing a lot of thinking, lately, and I think I've finally got a handle on why the pandemic has been so chronically stressful for me, and others, over the past year. Specifically those in first world countries, in relation to how it affects us on a psychological level. As people, we tend to experience bad things as happening suddenly, all at once, and then you deal with them. A broken leg, a car wreak, getting fired, getting dumped, etc. Deeply unpleasant, but relatively short-duration things. These are type-1 and type-2 problems; Things which can be avoided, or which can be fixed. But the Coronavirus has loaded us all down with the third type of problem. The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part. Lots of us weren't doing too great before the pandemic hit, but then, after 15 months of slow, grinding lockdowns, endless bad news on top of bad news, and nowhere to go to get away from it... Is it really a wonder why everyone is so unhappy all the time? I feel like a machine that's trying harder and harder to run without lubricant, to the point that it's just scraping metal-on-metal, and every day is a bit harder than the last. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to keep this up. The possibility of a variant wave in the Fall, forcing us back into yet another lockdown, terrifies me. I can't relax, I can't focus, and it's been seven or eight months since I've had any meaningful hope for the future.

I can't drive anymore because I don't have the strength in my arms to navigate the steering wheel. I can't even pick up a water glass with one hand. I sleep 3 or 4 hours a nite because the pain keeps waking me up. I made the tough decision today to withdraw from school this term because I just feel so delirious a lot of the time now that my brain can't do it. These physical and mental effects are just making me feel pretty bummed out and sad. I know that I'm lucky to not have it as bad as many other people during these Covid times. But I feel really alone in this, as everyone around me is getting vaccinated and going out and enjoying life, right as I'm getting so sick and homebound. I have faith that this will get better, I'm just having a hard time accepting that I need to put my life on hold until it does. Support, kind words, anything, much appreciated.

{"Reddit ID": "obufss", "Reddit Post": "Hi Folks, Hope y'all have been doing well. I'm from Germany, and I'm well, pretty worried about Delta Variant. I (22f) got my first shot of Biontech last week and so did my sister. My mom is fully vaccinated with Moderna. My stepdad received his first shot of Biontech two days ago. But we also have two kids (age 5 and 3) in our family. Obviously they can't get vaccinated. Hearing that Delta is very transmissible, and often even infects vaccinated folk, scares me. I know efficiency of the vaccines was never 100% but I believed at least we'd be safe from Covid when we get vaccinated. I work full-time and go to school. At school, everyone wears a mask, we are 1,5m apart, the windows are open and everyone gets tested daily. At work, my coworker wears a mask and so do I. When I eat or drink I go outside. Otherwise, I don't take off my mask at all (I wear FFP2 or FFP3). My boss doesn't wear a mask but he only occasionally comes into our office. Also, everyone at my work place had Corona three months ago except me. They caught Alpha (B117). I also have to take public transit. Everyone wears masks. Windows are open. How big is my risk of infection? I have been getting regularly tested since March 21 (1 to 4 times a week) and it came back negative all the time, even when we had a high national incidence and infection was more likely. National incidence is now 5 cases per 100.000 people. In my town it is 3 cases per 100.000 people. At the moment, we have 49 active cases (my town is huge; 500.000 people live here).

FWIW, I also live thousands of miles from all of my family. My anxiety got pretty bad several months ago during the holidays when Covid was at its peak and was impossible to see people.

My anxiety is always bad in the mornings; I dont get a lot of sleep because of it which makes it difficult to focus at work. Also, my anxiety gives me get bad stomach aches and I lose my appetite so it makes it really hard to eat. I usually have to force myself to eat every day which just isnt fun.

I'm struggling so much at the moment with having any sort of hope for the future. It just feels like we will never get normality back. COVID has completely ruined me. I went from being a (mostly) happy and functional human to depressed and suicidal since 2020. I take anti depressants now and I started therapy but even on my good days, I still feel like there's this dark cloud over my head and I'm waiting for the next shitstorm. I live in the UK and we've had three long lockdowns. Everything was looking pretty hopeful a few months ago, but since the last lockdown rules started easing, cases and hospitalisations have started rising again, even though we're doing pretty well with vaccinations. Our Government have handled the pandemic pretty poorly throughout and managed to let the Delta variant in with their loose border control measures. It just feels like this never ending cycle of rising cases, lockdown, falling cases, lift lockdown, rising cases again, etc etc and I'm terrified of going into another lockdown in the Autumn. I can't do it again. We keep saying the lockdowns are to protect our (underfunded) NHS from being overwhelmed but if hospitalisations are already getting too high now in the SUMMER, how the hell will they cope with a Winter wave with not only COVID cases but also a new wave of Flu cases which have been low the last year because of the lockdowns??? I feel guilty for complaining as I know other people have it much worse, and having already had the virus, it's not affected me all that badly. But the restrictions have meant I can no longer do my job (musician), I can't meet a partner, I've lost all hope for the future and I just feel like I'm waiting for the next bit of bad news. If the vaccines aren't enough for getting us out of this shit, what will be???? I just don't feel like life is worth living anymore under these restrictions.

While the last year and a half have been trying emotionally and professionally for all of us, things are looking up with the vaccine. However, my wife's parents refuse to get vaccinated. They are not in great health and my father-in-law specifically is older and I worry about his health. Therefore, even as things have started to open up, my family has been relatively more conservative, with no masks-free indoor interaction outside of the family, even with people that are vaccinated, for fear of spreading the virus to my inlaws. This is becoming a big problem because I am building a startup and my cofounder is someone I met during the pandemic. He and I need to start building a more regular working cadence and relationship, but this is really difficult since my wife and SIL are not comfortable with me working in person with him, even though he is vaccinated (though he is much less careful than us). For my part, I would like to push the company forward, and agree that our creative work would improve if we were able to work in-person a couple of times per week. I'm just at a loss - my wife is grieving what she perceives as the loss of her parents' sanity and doesn't want to cut them off, but I face real professional challenges (let alone the ongoing personal and mental health challenges) from continuing the status quo.

{"Reddit ID": "oga1in", "Reddit Post": "This lockdown has gone on forever. From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all.

Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore.

Granted, I did not have a cover (forgot it) but was sitting discretely and had a shirt on that hid most everything.\nA barista came over and asked that I use the Family Room (washroom with change table, microwave and lazy boy chair) to do feedings, as it was \"potentially unhygienic\" and \"other patrons may be uncomfortable.\" She also said that is what the room is designed for.\n\nSince this is an independent store, do they have the right to make this request? They didn't tell me I had to leave, just go to a different area.

Does it interfere with your work and life too much?

It  only affects her palms and the soles of her feet. She's always been self-conscious about it, and I've tried lots of different remedies. Her doctor prescribed a roll-on type of gel to stop the sweating in her palms and feet, but it is such a hassle to use, we don't bother. You actually have to apply it before bedtime, then wrap the hands and feet in gauze, then cover with plastic. Wtf?\n\n\nEvery time I hold her hand sh'es embarrassed because her hands are soaking wet. When she does homework she has to get up and wash and dry her hands several times. It's very frustrating to her. She's worried she will never get to have a boyfriend, because every time she'll hold hands with him, her palms will be soaking wet. I feel terrible for her, and I have never known anyone personally who has this problem.\n\n\nAnyways, I understand there is a very minor, hardly invasive surgery available for this, wherein the doctor makes a small incision between two of the rids, and basically snips and cauterizes the nerve that triggers this sweating. Anyone ever do this? I'm a little worried, and I've told her for years that we will consider the surgery only as a last resort, and only after puberty.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_parenting", "Model": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "Sure, I can help you reappraise the situation.

While the roll-on gel prescribed by her doctor may not be practical for her to use, there are other options available that may be more effective and less invasive.\n\nOne option to consider is iontophoresis, a non-invasive treatment that involves using a small device to deliver a mild electric current to the affected areas. This can help reduce sweating and is typically done in a series of sessions. Another option is botulinum toxin injections, which can temporarily relax the sweat glands and reduce sweating.\n\nIt's understandable that you and your daughter have been hesitant to consider surgery, but it may be worth exploring this option further. The minor surgery you mentioned, which involves snipping and cauterizing the nerve that triggers sweating, can be a highly effective solution for hyperhidrosis.

She's 8 months old and as cute as can be.  The thing is - we get a LOT of attention when we go out with her.  Is this normal?  She's our first, and I was in no way prepared for the number of people who would stop us, want to see her, want to take pictures of her, want to ooohh and ahhh over her all the time.  \n\nI'm sure as she gets a little older, this will decrease.

We usually give him 6oz in a bottle, and this bottle was full almost to the brim. This is a [Playtex DropIn](http://playtexbaby.com/Bottles/Dropins/Premium-Nurser) bottle, FYI. \n\nSo I call up the day care and ask them what the deal is, this is much more than 6oz of formula.

I grab my own measuring cup, fill it with 6oz of water, and pour it into the bottle. Lo and behold, it fills to something like 7.5 oz according to the markings on the side of the bottle. \n\nAm I completely missing something here, or is Playtex being very irresponsible about their dropin measurements?

The teacher sits at her desk basically all day while the kids do worksheets that are overly simplistic even for their young age.  Friday, she sent home progress reports.  The scores just didn't really fit my son's strengths and weaknesses.  A friend that also has a child in the class and I compared notes and the scores for both children were exactly the same-all 19 of them.  So, I'm guessing she just filled this evaluation the same for each student.  What do you think I should do about it?
