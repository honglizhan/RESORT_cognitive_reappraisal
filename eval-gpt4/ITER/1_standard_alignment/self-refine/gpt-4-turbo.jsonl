I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh. \n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, \"oh hes not that,\" and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking.

She actually said she liked me 2 years prior (we have 1.5 years of online school), but I ghosted her which was very dumb and entirely my fault.

If you work for an employer they normally work out how much tax etc you owe and it's deducted at source so what you get in your pay check is yours. But if you're self employed you have to fill in a tax return each year. You can fill in the return from the 6th April and it has to be done by 31st January the following year. So the tax return I've just submitted is for tax year 2020-2021.\n\nI hate doing my tax return. My accounts are really simple, profits easy to calculate and very few expenses. But I'm so paranoid I'll do something wrong. There's so many different fields to fill in and I have no clue what half of them mean. I've always asked my sister to sit with me in the past when I do my returns but this year I did it all on my own.\n\nTo further complicate matters my accounts last year are screwed up because of coronavirus. My income was down ~75% but I was eligible for a government support scheme called the Self Employment Income Support Scheme. However I then had to declare all these figures on my tax returns which was even more boxes to tick.\n\nI also had to claim my fifth grant which means working out my turnover for the last two years etc. and freaking out that I'll somehow claim the wrong amount or screw something up.\n\nIt took me two weeks of staring at the folder to build up the courage and then about half an hour ago I finally hit that sweet spot of the anxiety of not doing it outweighing the anxiety of doing it (the grant deadline is September).

The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part.

I can't relax, I can't focus, and it's been seven or eight months since I've had any meaningful hope for the future.

{"Reddit ID": "obufss", "Reddit Post": "Hi Folks, Hope y'all have been doing well. I'm from Germany, and I'm well, pretty worried about Delta Variant. I (22f) got my first shot of Biontech last week and so did my sister. My mom is fully vaccinated with Moderna. My stepdad received his first shot of Biontech two days ago. But we also have two kids (age 5 and 3) in our family. Obviously they can't get vaccinated. Hearing that Delta is very transmissible, and often even infects vaccinated folk, scares me. I know efficiency of the vaccines was never 100% but I believed at least we'd be safe from Covid when we get vaccinated. I work full-time and go to school. At school, everyone wears a mask, we are 1,5m apart, the windows are open and everyone gets tested daily. At work, my coworker wears a mask and so do I. When I eat or drink I go outside. Otherwise, I don't take off my mask at all (I wear FFP2 or FFP3). My boss doesn't wear a mask but he only occasionally comes into our office. Also, everyone at my work place had Corona three months ago except me. They caught Alpha (B117). I also have to take public transit. Everyone wears masks. Windows are open. How big is my risk of infection? I have been getting regularly tested since March 21 (1 to 4 times a week) and it came back negative all the time, even when we had a high national incidence and infection was more likely. National incidence is now 5 cases per 100.000 people. In my town it is 3 cases per 100.000 people. At the moment, we have 49 active cases (my town is huge; 500.000 people live here). Do I really have to be worried? I even wear my ffp2 mask when I walk my dog. When I am fully vaccinated, what safety measures should I still follow? I don't mind masks at all, but I'd like to wear makeup someday again lol.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_covid19_support", "Model": "gpt-4-turbo", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "The precautions you're taking are robust\u2014vaccination, regular testing, mask-wearing, and social distancing significantly reduce your risk of infection.

While the last year and a half have been trying emotionally and professionally for all of us, things are looking up with the vaccine. However, my wife's parents refuse to get vaccinated. They are not in great health and my father-in-law specifically is older and I worry about his health. Therefore, even as things have started to open up, my family has been relatively more conservative, with no masks-free indoor interaction outside of the family, even with people that are vaccinated, for fear of spreading the virus to my inlaws. This is becoming a big problem because I am building a startup and my cofounder is someone I met during the pandemic. He and I need to start building a more regular working cadence and relationship, but this is really difficult since my wife and SIL are not comfortable with me working in person with him, even though he is vaccinated (though he is much less careful than us). For my part, I would like to push the company forward, and agree that our creative work would improve if we were able to work in-person a couple of times per week. I'm just at a loss - my wife is grieving what she perceives as the loss of her parents' sanity and doesn't want to cut them off, but I face real professional challenges (let alone the ongoing personal and mental health challenges) from continuing the status quo.
