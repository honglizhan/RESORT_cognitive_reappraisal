One day I broke a dresser drawer and kind of grew out of it there, but recently I've gotten back into the habit of it. When I get too flustered rather than damaging objects I find myself targetting my own body. Whether that be my face, or chest, or thighs, or anywhere really. I don't even realize I've done it until it's already over. I get bruises and can't explain them if anyone asks (luckily no one has).

For example, when feeling flustered, instead of striking oneself, one could try deep breathing exercises, squeezing a stress ball, or engaging in physical exercise. It's also beneficial to practice mindfulness and self-compassion, acknowledging the stress without judgment and treating oneself with kindness.

I'm afraid I'll get annoyed at her while she's not doing anything wrong. I'm very organized and detail oriented and get irritated if anything is out of order. I also am a person who hyper-focuses (not sure if this is a word) on schoolwork, and any distraction from others gets on my nerves easily. This happened with my roommate last semester. I was so overwhelmed with work &amp; uncomfortable around her that everything she did made my blood boil and I'd cry when she'd leave. I don't want this to happen with my best friend and ruin our friendship, and possibly other friendships (since we are in the same friend group). Since I've moved my things into our room I avoid our group chat and things that remind me of her because I get sudden overwhelming feelings &amp; feelings of annoyance. \n\nI'm assuming that I'm feeling annoyed with her right now because I'm anxious about going back to school, a new room assignment, living with others, and starting a new routine.

It doesn't happen too often since I usually take my clothes out and fold them before she even notices I did laundry, but I forget every once in a while and every time it makes my day a bit worse. I told her today that I don't care if it's 4am and I'm asleep, I want her to at least warn me that she's going to touch my clothes if I don't get up right away. \n\nI went back to my room after taking my clothes and I wanted to scream but I always manage to stop myself by just pretending to yell and by punching my mattress and pillows.

I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious.

It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh. \n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, \"oh hes not that,\" and move on.

{"Reddit ID": "Anxiety_10", "Reddit Post": "Is it weird to talk to a girl after 2 years of not talking to her? Hi I have social anxiety and I was wondering, there's this girl that occasionally walks past me in the hallway and we were classmates for one year in a class and I have tried to initiate contact with her. She actually said she liked me 2 years prior (we have 1.5 years of online school), but I ghosted her which was very dumb and entirely my fault. I have miserably failed because of my social anxiety around her. My heart races and my mind goes blank with hesitation every time I'm around her. I haven't really talked to her for 2 years, so I am thinking that I would come off as a creep if I were to talk to her.

I know automation and machines have always replaced workers, but there was always new stuff to do.  I have this great fear of the world just turning out like Wall-e, where everyone just sits around, while robots do all the work.  This is an actual fear of mine, and my brain is constantly trying to find ways to show that yes, people are getting lazier, yes people are getting dumber.  Or you actually like going to school in person, using paper money, shopping in physical stores, hobbies where you work with your hands?  No one wants that anymore, in the future everything will be all computers and technology.

This is my first time posting on here. I will be 19 in two days, I have been struggling with anxiety, and depression for about three years now, at least that's when it got really bad. I panic through out all day almost every day about every little thing and I am in bed all day every day, too scared to stay standing up for longer than going to get food or to the bathroom before I run back to my bed. This has gotten so bad I'm unable to work, socialize with friends and family, or do something as simple as take my dog for a walk. I am barely holding on and I can't handle much more of this. I was prescribed Cipralex a few months ago and I only took that for a few days because medication is one of the many things that give me anxiety, and than I search every little thing and scare myself into even feeling sick. Today I was prescribed sertraline, and I even went to pick it up and it's in my medicine cabinet now. I read up on this medication for so long and I'm so scared to start it not knowing what to expect, so I guess I'm just looking for advice and to hear other peoples stories and hopefully gain some motivation and courage to start this medication that could potentially change my life.

I have very thick hair, so a lot of it was coming out. I've had severe brain fog, which hasn't been the least bit helpful during a time when I have to be the most alert and *with it*'. I've had no appetite, and now my trousers are all loose, with one  pair literally falling down when I walk. The most bizarre symptom I've had is this weird jaw tension - my jaw is very clicky, and it feels incredibly tense and stiff. As a hypochondriac, I was convinced this was a heart attack, but I was reassured that it's probably just anxiety. I've had weird gastrointestinal symptoms, where I feel nauseous, and have this pit in my stomach all of the time, which could be caused by the lack of eating, but it persists even when I have eaten. \n\nAnd then of course feelings of impending doom, etc etc. \n\nI just can't wait for this to be over.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_anxiety", "Model": "gpt-4-turbo", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "It's important to recognize that the physical symptoms you're experiencing are common manifestations of stress and anxiety, especially during high-pressure periods like exams.

It's a daily occurrence of cursing and raging at his game and it stresses me out beyond belief. More than it should for what it is, I think. \n\nInstinctively I feel a strong urge to flee, to get away from the house, or his vicinity or even ending the relationship altogether because I feel I've reached my tolerance limit. \n\nI'd think that's how I usually get around people who are generally very emotional in a negative way - I want to flee from them and get them out of my life completely. Even when they're generally nice and good to me, this instance of being negative affects me to the point where I cannot see anything but it and not feel anything for them but... aversion? \n\nMaybe it's possible to go through life and avoid such people altogether, but I'm sure there are situations where you somehow just have to deal with it, being in a relationship at times or maybe in a workplace environment or with family members. \n\nI've asked him to stop many times, it's gotten better, a bit, but I don't think he'll ever stop, and I cannot control him or other people, so I'd like to find a way to control it within myself.

If you work for an employer they normally work out how much tax etc you owe and it's deducted at source so what you get in your pay check is yours. But if you're self employed you have to fill in a tax return each year. You can fill in the return from the 6th April and it has to be done by 31st January the following year. So the tax return I've just submitted is for tax year 2020-2021.\n\nI hate doing my tax return. My accounts are really simple, profits easy to calculate and very few expenses. But I'm so paranoid I'll do something wrong. There's so many different fields to fill in and I have no clue what half of them mean. I've always asked my sister to sit with me in the past when I do my returns but this year I did it all on my own.\n\nTo further complicate matters my accounts last year are screwed up because of coronavirus. My income was down ~75% but I was eligible for a government support scheme called the Self Employment Income Support Scheme. However I then had to declare all these figures on my tax returns which was even more boxes to tick.\n\nI also had to claim my fifth grant which means working out my turnover for the last two years etc. and freaking out that I'll somehow claim the wrong amount or screw something up.\n\nIt took me two weeks of staring at the folder to build up the courage and then about half an hour ago I finally hit that sweet spot of the anxiety of not doing it outweighing the anxiety of doing it (the grant deadline is September).

He was the kindest and purest human being. I met him briefly yesterday as we took him to the hospital. Today he passed away from COVID, he was deathly afraid from needles and the vaccination.

The death feels like it could have been avoided, he took the remaining precautions but it didnt work. At least he died happy alongside his family in his hometown where I live. I dont know what or how to live life without him in my mind, without meeting him ever again, with seeing the same places without him. Im tired, I want to cry. We both hated living at home now I am stuck living on earth without him, I feel this home is the right place for me - was waiting eagerly for him to return.

After the third and a half week or so, I felt well enough to put in a full workout. I did so, and 48 hours later, my Covid symptoms had returned in pretty much full force. I've read about different forms \"long Covid\" takes - it's not always persistent - some report reinfection or reactivation of Covid after periods of dormancy. Two weeks after my initial reactivation, my symptoms begin to subside. I decide to get the first Covid vaccine (I read that in some \"vaccine vanguard\" countries like Israel, they were recommending one covid shot for those who had already had the virus). I get the first shot, and feel a little not great for about 48 hours or so (mild discomfort in lymph nodes, some fatigue, weakness), but afterwards I begin to feel great, better than I had at any point since before I got Covid in early May. A week ago I put in a full exercise. About 24 hours later, I don't feel like I felt when I had Covid, but I definitely feel the exact same as I did *after* I had gotten my first shot - mild discomfort in lymph nodes, some weakness. I am under the impression working out a second time \"reactivated\" dormant Covid, but the vaccine kicked back in and enlisted my immune system in fighting this second activation. Finding information about the virus at this time has been so frustrating - official counsel has lagged internet anecdotes and similar by a considerable amount of time.

{"Reddit ID": "o93rqd", "Reddit Post": "Hey, everyone, just in a particularly dark patch, and feeling the need for some dialogue. I've been doing a lot of thinking, lately, and I think I've finally got a handle on why the pandemic has been so chronically stressful for me, and others, over the past year. Specifically those in first world countries, in relation to how it affects us on a psychological level. As people, we tend to experience bad things as happening suddenly, all at once, and then you deal with them. A broken leg, a car wreak, getting fired, getting dumped, etc. Deeply unpleasant, but relatively short-duration things. These are type-1 and type-2 problems; Things which can be avoided, or which can be fixed. But the Coronavirus has loaded us all down with the third type of problem. The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part. Lots of us weren't doing too great before the pandemic hit, but then, after 15 months of slow, grinding lockdowns, endless bad news on top of bad news, and nowhere to go to get away from it... Is it really a wonder why everyone is so unhappy all the time? I feel like a machine that's trying harder and harder to run without lubricant, to the point that it's just scraping metal-on-metal, and every day is a bit harder than the last. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to keep this up. The possibility of a variant wave in the Fall, forcing us back into yet another lockdown, terrifies me. I can't relax, I can't focus, and it's been seven or eight months since I've had any meaningful hope for the future. This late in the game, I just... can't shake the feeling that things will never get better. 2019 was the best things will ever be in my lifetime, and it's all downhill from here.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_covid19_support", "Model": "gpt-4-turbo", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "It's important to recognize that the pandemic is a global challenge, not a personal failure.

I (22f) got my first shot of Biontech last week and so did my sister. My mom is fully vaccinated with Moderna. My stepdad received his first shot of Biontech two days ago. But we also have two kids (age 5 and 3) in our family. Obviously they can't get vaccinated. Hearing that Delta is very transmissible, and often even infects vaccinated folk, scares me. I know efficiency of the vaccines was never 100% but I believed at least we'd be safe from Covid when we get vaccinated. I work full-time and go to school. At school, everyone wears a mask, we are 1,5m apart, the windows are open and everyone gets tested daily. At work, my coworker wears a mask and so do I. When I eat or drink I go outside. Otherwise, I don't take off my mask at all (I wear FFP2 or FFP3). My boss doesn't wear a mask but he only occasionally comes into our office.

FWIW, I also live thousands of miles from all of my family. My anxiety got pretty bad several months ago during the holidays when Covid was at its peak and was impossible to see people. I was also still furloughed from work and had a lot of time to think (and overthink). Ive dealt with mild anxiety in the past but nothing like this. During that time it got so bad that I drove thousands of miles to be with relatives. I was able to spend time with them in the evenings which was really helpful and eventually I felt back to normal for the most part. Since then Ive also gotten my job back. However, during the last month Ive gone through a breakup of sorts and that has brought my anxiety back. I lived alone for several years before this and it used to be awesome for me but now it just feels painful. Im almost afraid of being alone. My anxiety is always bad in the mornings; I dont get a lot of sleep because of it which makes it difficult to focus at work. Also, my anxiety gives me get bad stomach aches and I lose my appetite so it makes it really hard to eat. I usually have to force myself to eat every day which just isnt fun. My work is partially opened up and Ive been trying to go in at least a few hours a day just to be around other humans. That helps for sure. Ive been trying to take early morning bike rides as soon as I get up and that typically helps but in the few hours before work starts, Im still rather anxious. Ive tried meditating (which kinda makes things worse), journaling, watching mindless TV, reaching out to friends, etc. I talk to a therapist on a weekly basis which has been helpful. I tried antidepressants (SSRIs) for about 6 months or so and they made my anxiety worse at first and I didnt feel like they were super helpful after that.

{"Reddit ID": "ofmx9a", "Reddit Post": "Hi! I have an appointment booked for my second dose of Pfizer on Monday, with the possibility of moving it up to tomorrow. I struggle with severe food allergies and therefore getting the first dose of the vaccine was incredibly difficult for me. I feared having a severe allergic reaction and had many panic attacks leading up to the vaccine appointment. Luckily, all went well and Im not anticipating my second dose. However, I have a few fears. First, I developed an odd skin reaction approximately one week after vaccination. My forearms became incredibly itchy for about 2-3 days, but I never developed a rash or anything of the sorts.

While the last year and a half have been trying emotionally and professionally for all of us, things are looking up with the vaccine. However, my wife's parents refuse to get vaccinated. They are not in great health and my father-in-law specifically is older and I worry about his health. Therefore, even as things have started to open up, my family has been relatively more conservative, with no masks-free indoor interaction outside of the family, even with people that are vaccinated, for fear of spreading the virus to my inlaws. This is becoming a big problem because I am building a startup and my cofounder is someone I met during the pandemic. He and I need to start building a more regular working cadence and relationship, but this is really difficult since my wife and SIL are not comfortable with me working in person with him, even though he is vaccinated (though he is much less careful than us). For my part, I would like to push the company forward, and agree that our creative work would improve if we were able to work in-person a couple of times per week. I'm just at a loss - my wife is grieving what she perceives as the loss of her parents' sanity and doesn't want to cut them off, but I face real professional challenges (let alone the ongoing personal and mental health challenges) from continuing the status quo.

From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to. I feel like I've become so negative that I don't want to share my thoughts with people because I will bring them down, and I already feel like I pushed some people away by doing this.

I've always been extremely responsible, I've worn all the gear, all the time, gotten the training, and obey traffic laws.  My wife, bless her, has never pressured me to leave them behind.  In fact she pressures the exact opposite since she doesn't want to hear me gripe about not having a bike.\n\nMy son is thirteen months old.  Every time I leave on the bike I make sure the last thing I say to him, and my wife is that I love them.  A small part of this is too ensure that if I'm on the bike and my number comes up, the last thing I've said to them is the most important thing that needs to be said.\n\nI don't think I can do this anymore.  Today, while riding, I just couldn't stop thinking about how absurd my little ritual is since I'm actually out there doing something that increases the likely hood that my innocent \"I love you\" really will the last thing they hear me say.\n\nSo, I'm curious how other bikers dealt with this.

Is it possible to do both 1/2 public and 1/2 home somehow?\n\nEdit: I guess I should clarify- I no way intend to keep my daughter out of social activities, I would most likely have her attend a home-schooling co-op should my decision sway this way. I would also have tutors come over and help her in the areas I have trouble with (math...) so that she doesn't struggle her way through college or group projects. Also, I know how home-schooling can be abused (and why that is one reason it is controversial), my partner and I are both very open minded, free-thinking people who love to explore all realms of ideologies and theories (in other words we aren't going to shove her in Jesus camp and tell her that everyone is evil and wrong except us), also I would have her attend summer camps or maybe join a club so that she would get plenty of social interaction not to mention give us both a brief break from one another (kids need space too!). \n\nI just want her to have a better experience than I did in public schools. I wish I'd learned what I know now back then (I guess we all do) but the classes I was offered were mostly test-prep and my teachers were very, how you say, \"Do what I say, don't ask questions, shut up sit down\" etc...\n\nWe can't afford private school, but there are other school systems I'm looking into, and I have years to decide, I just want to be informed is all. \n\nThanks for everyone's input, I greatly appreciate it!", "Sub-Reddit": "r_parenting", "Model": "gpt-4-turbo", "intermediate_output_dim_1": "<reappraisal>[Exploring various educational options shows proactive parenting.

Maybe he's more afraid of going upstairs alone at night time (not necessarily afraid of the dark), or maybe he's more afraid of just being alone upstairs. I have to sit on the bed with him while he sleeps (putting him to sleep), and then I can safely walk away safely after he has fallen asleep completely. If I walk away 2 minutes into putting him to sleep, while he hasn't fallen asleep yet, he'll tell me 'please stay', almost begging me to stay. If I tell him to go up and sleep by himself, he refuses. If he stays up late downstairs, then he might just fall asleep on the sofa. This is becoming a headache and it wastes about 20-30 mins of my time every night while putting him to sleep.\n\nIt's been like this for years, I just figured one day he'll say 'ok I'm ready to do this on my own'.
