This has not only caused me and my family hundreds of dollars of damages, but I also usually get hurt in the process. Sure, wounds can heal, but having them in the first place because of a mental breakdown because my pen has dried out is a pretty fucked up thing in my book. \n\nI tried putting said things down before starting to hit something, but I just have zero self control and can't consistently do so. I also tried calming myself down by just staying still and doing nothing, but that usually gets me even more angry and I cause more harm to myself. I tried hitting other things like my pillows, but that causes almost the same effect as staying still. And after I break something I get sober and realize what I just did and get a bad feeling of doom or whatever that is.\n\nIs there any way I can at the very least minimize these breakouts?

I speak and understand Spanish really well, but combined with my anxiety and the language barrier, I won't talk very much\n\nOne time, we went to someone's house for New Years Eve. We had been there for five hours already, and I got kind of bored of listening to people talk. It's not that they're boring, but for me, listening to people talk in a language that's not my native language is difficult after several hours. I guess I was turning my head a lot, trying to find an interesting conversation, when my aunt asked me \"does it embarrass you to look at people?\" With a smile on her face\n\nA couple of days later, we went to a party with mariachi. When we got there, my aunt said \"smile, look confident. Didn't your mother ever teach you that?\" With a smile on her face. An hour later, some people we knew arrived. After greeting them, we walked back to our table. I was ahead of my aunt, and I looked down for a split second. She said \"(my name), don't look down\". \n\nAnother time, we went to someone's house for dinner. The hostess asked me if I liked the town. I said yes. I wanted to elaborate, but I had food in my mouth. The subject had already changed when my aunt started looking at me in my peripheral vision.

I was prescribed Cipralex a few months ago and I only took that for a few days because medication is one of the many things that give me anxiety, and than I search every little thing and scare myself into even feeling sick. Today I was prescribed sertraline, and I even went to pick it up and it's in my medicine cabinet now.

If you work for an employer they normally work out how much tax etc you owe and it's deducted at source so what you get in your pay check is yours. But if you're self employed you have to fill in a tax return each year. You can fill in the return from the 6th April and it has to be done by 31st January the following year. So the tax return I've just submitted is for tax year 2020-2021.\n\nI hate doing my tax return. My accounts are really simple, profits easy to calculate and very few expenses.

I've always asked my sister to sit with me in the past when I do my returns but this year I did it all on my own.\n\nTo further complicate matters my accounts last year are screwed up because of coronavirus. My income was down ~75% but I was eligible for a government support scheme called the Self Employment Income Support Scheme.

{"Reddit ID": "o7lkru", "Reddit Post": "Recently, the Israeli government reinstituted its indoor mask mandate after about 300 Israelis were diagnosed with COVID-19. As a result, many people are fearing that COVID-19 restrictions will be constantly looming over us for the rest of human history, persistently drifting in and out of our lives. I'd like to explain why these fears simply are not rational. Despite what some say, Israel has not achieved herd immunity. They are very close, of course, but they are not at that milestone *yet.* About 5,160,000 Israelis are fully vaccinated, equivalent to roughly 56% of the Israeli population is fully vaccinated. Add that to all the Israelis who have attained natural immunity from the virus, and the percentage rate of immunity within Israel arrives at roughly 66%. For a group to have herd immunity to COVID-19, 70% must be immune. Because Israel has yet to achieve herd immunity, it is still possible for an outbreak to take place. Even with this in mind, the outbreak Israel has been facing is minuscule compared to the size of outbreaks at any point in 2020.

These are type-1 and type-2 problems; Things which can be avoided, or which can be fixed. But the Coronavirus has loaded us all down with the third type of problem. The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part. Lots of us weren't doing too great before the pandemic hit, but then, after 15 months of slow, grinding lockdowns, endless bad news on top of bad news, and nowhere to go to get away from it... Is it really a wonder why everyone is so unhappy all the time? I feel like a machine that's trying harder and harder to run without lubricant, to the point that it's just scraping metal-on-metal, and every day is a bit harder than the last. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to keep this up. The possibility of a variant wave in the Fall, forcing us back into yet another lockdown, terrifies me. I can't relax, I can't focus, and it's been seven or eight months since I've had any meaningful hope for the future.

I know efficiency of the vaccines was never 100% but I believed at least we'd be safe from Covid when we get vaccinated. I work full-time and go to school. At school, everyone wears a mask, we are 1,5m apart, the windows are open and everyone gets tested daily. At work, my coworker wears a mask and so do I. When I eat or drink I go outside. Otherwise, I don't take off my mask at all (I wear FFP2 or FFP3). My boss doesn't wear a mask but he only occasionally comes into our office.

While the last year and a half have been trying emotionally and professionally for all of us, things are looking up with the vaccine. However, my wife's parents refuse to get vaccinated. They are not in great health and my father-in-law specifically is older and I worry about his health. Therefore, even as things have started to open up, my family has been relatively more conservative, with no masks-free indoor interaction outside of the family, even with people that are vaccinated, for fear of spreading the virus to my inlaws. This is becoming a big problem because I am building a startup and my cofounder is someone I met during the pandemic. He and I need to start building a more regular working cadence and relationship, but this is really difficult since my wife and SIL are not comfortable with me working in person with him, even though he is vaccinated (though he is much less careful than us). For my part, I would like to push the company forward, and agree that our creative work would improve if we were able to work in-person a couple of times per week. I'm just at a loss - my wife is grieving what she perceives as the loss of her parents' sanity and doesn't want to cut them off, but I face real professional challenges (let alone the ongoing personal and mental health challenges) from continuing the status quo.

{"Reddit ID": "oga1in", "Reddit Post": "This lockdown has gone on forever. From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household.

Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all.

The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up.

Losing your temper or reacting harshly can escalate the situation and make it more difficult to resolve.\n4.

Instead of focusing on her coping mechanisms, you might consider addressing the root cause of her stress and anxiety - the uncertainty and unpredictability of her grandparents' comings and goings.\n\nOne potential approach could be to establish a consistent routine and set of expectations for your daughter, so that she knows what to expect and can feel more secure and in control. Additionally, you might consider providing her with age-appropriate information about the situation and reassuring her that she is safe and loved, even when her grandparents are not present.\n\nOverall, it's important to be patient, understanding, and supportive as your daughter navigates this challenging situation.
