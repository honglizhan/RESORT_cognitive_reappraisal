Use \"I\" statements to express your feelings and needs, such as \"I feel disrespected when you yell at me. Please communicate with me in a more respectful way.\"\n2. Set boundaries: Let your sister know that you will not engage in conversations that involve yelling. If she continues to yell, you can politely walk away or take a break from the conversation.\n3.

Ask yourself if the other person's words or actions are really a reflection of your worth or abilities.\n2. Reframe their words: Instead of internalizing their words, try to reframe them as a reflection of the other person's insecurity or lack of self-awareness.

Set boundaries: If someone is consistently mocking or belittling you, it may be necessary to set boundaries or distance yourself from the person.

For example, \"I feel frustrated when you interrupt me, as it makes me feel disrespected and not heard.\"\n4. Seek support: Talk to trusted friends or a therapist about your feelings and experiences. It may be helpful to have a safe space to process your emotions and gain perspective.\n5. Take a break: If the situation becomes too overwhelming, it's okay to step away and take a break.

However, it's important to remember that you don't have to take on the responsibility for other people's behavior.\n\nWhen you lose, it's okay to acknowledge your own mistakes and learn from them, but you don't have to internalize the losses as a reflection of your self-worth. In fact, it's important to recognize that losing is a natural part of the game and doesn't define your intelligence or abilities.\n\nMoreover, it's not productive to make up excuses for your losses or blame others for your mistakes. Instead, focus on what you can control and take responsibility for your own actions.\n\nHere are some guidelines to help you reappraise the situation:\n\n1.

Focus on the present moment: Rather than dwelling on past mistakes or worrying about future losses, stay present and focused on the game at hand.\n4. Communicate with your opponents: If someone is being disrespectful or taunting you, try talking to them and addressing the issue.

Try to pinpoint the root cause of your anger.\n2. Break it down: If the issue is related to the game, break it down into smaller, manageable parts. For example, are there specific in-game mechanics that trigger your anger? Can you identify any patterns in your own behavior that might be contributing to your anger?\n3. Focus on what you can control: Instead of getting frustrated with things you can't control (like other players' behavior), focus on what you can control. For example, you can control your own gameplay, your attitude, and your reactions to others.\n4. Develop a plan: Create a to-do list of specific steps you can take to address the issue. For example, you might start by practicing mindfulness while playing, or by setting specific goals for yourself that have nothing to do with winning or losing.\n5. Seek support: If you feel overwhelmed by the situation, don't be afraid to reach out to friends or family for support. Talking through your feelings with someone who cares about you can be a powerful way to gain perspective and find solutions.\n6. Celebrate your successes: As you work on addressing the issue, take time to celebrate your successes, no matter how small they may seem.

While it's understandable that you want to help and support your sister, it's important to recognize that you cannot control her emotions or behavior. Instead of focusing on what you could have done differently, try to focus on what you can control, such as your own reactions and responses to the situation.\n\nHere are some specific guidelines that may help you reappraise the situation:\n\n1. Practice self-care: Take care of yourself by doing things that make you feel good, such as reading, exercising, or spending time with friends. This can help you feel more resilient and better equipped to handle difficult situations.\n2. Set boundaries: It's okay to set boundaries with your sister, such as not engaging in conversations that feel disrespectful or hurtful. You don't have to tolerate behavior that makes you feel bad about yourself.\n3. Seek support: Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or therapist about your experiences with your sister. It can be helpful to have someone to talk to who can offer support and perspective.\n4. Practice mindfulness: When your sister is yelling or being disruptive, try to focus on the present moment rather than getting caught up in her emotions. Take a few deep breaths and try to stay calm.\n5. Consider a different approach: Instead of trying to \"fix\" the situation or make your sister feel better, try approaching her with empathy and understanding. Ask her if she's okay and if there's anything she needs. This can help shift the dynamic of the situation and may reduce her anger.\n\nRemember, you cannot control your sister's emotions or behavior, but you can control how you respond to her. By taking care of yourself, setting boundaries, seeking support, practicing mindfulness, and considering a different approach, you can reappraise the situation and respond in a way that feels healthy and empowering for you.", "evaluation_raw_output_dim_1": 4, "reappraisal_output_dim_4": "Narrator, let's break down this situation into manageable parts and tackle each aspect step by step.

Start by making a to-do list of specific actions you can take to address the issue.

With each accomplishment, you'll feel empowered and in control of the situation. If needed, don't hesitate to seek support from friends and family to help you navigate this process.

It's important to recognize that you can't control how others behave or what they say, but you can control how you respond to them.\n\nIn the case of the argument that led to you smashing your phone, it may not be necessary to take full responsibility for the situation. Instead of beating yourself up over it, try to reframe it as a misunderstanding or a difference of opinion. It's possible that the other person's words or actions were not intended to be hurtful or provoking.\n\nWhen it comes to repeating things more than twice, it's important to communicate your boundaries and needs clearly. If someone is consistently not respecting your boundaries, it may be necessary to re-evaluate the relationship or seek support from a trusted friend, family member, or therapist.\n\nIn general, it's important to prioritize self-care and stress management techniques, such as deep breathing, exercise, or talking to a trusted friend or therapist. It's also important to practice mindfulness and self-compassion, rather than beating yourself up over mistakes or perceived shortcomings.\n\nRemember that everyone makes mistakes and it's okay to ask for help when you need it.

It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and frustrated by your tendency to get angry and act impulsively. The first step in managing your anger is to focus on the problem at hand and ask yourself if there's anything you can do to address it.\n\nStart by breaking down the issue into smaller, more manageable parts. For example, if you find yourself getting angry when someone repeats themselves more than twice, try to identify the root cause of your frustration. Is it because you feel disrespected or ignored? Once you understand the reason behind your anger, you can start working on a plan to address it.\n\nMaybe you can set boundaries with the person, like politely asking them to stop repeating themselves after the first time. Or maybe you can practice active listening and try to understand their perspective. Whatever the solution may be, start by focusing on one step at a time and take it from there.\n\nRemember, you don't have to tackle this alone.

Maybe there's a way to gather more information or evidence to support your claim. Or perhaps you can talk to someone else who might be more receptive to what you have to say.\n\nOnce you've identified a specific problem to tackle, break it down into smaller, manageable steps.

When we got there, my aunt said \"smile, look confident. Didn't your mother ever teach you that?\" With a smile on her face. An hour later, some people we knew arrived. After greeting them, we walked back to our table. I was ahead of my aunt, and I looked down for a split second. She said \"(my name), don't look down\". \n\nAnother time, we went to someone's house for dinner. The hostess asked me if I liked the town. I said yes.

And Xanax never did anything to me besides brutally kill my appetite.\n\nAmbien on the other hand... ignoring the part where we get crazy and do stuff that we will regret later, like texting an old crush and asking him on a date (yeah, I had the date... today, btw! oh well, it was fast)... so, what I was saying is that the good part of Ambien is that you feel some kind of freedom and a really peaceful state of mind.\n\nLSD gave me the closest to what I should feel to be the happiest... but only during the trip. But then there's a problem: you can never know what your next trip will be like. And from paradise I went to pure nightmare (ER and shit). So I don't feel like trying it again even microdosing - same goes for shrooms. And weed... yeah, it's pleasurable and shit, but I don't know how it would be if I use it in long term.\n\nI'm thinking more of a controlled substance for now, aimed for anxiety and is similar to what Ambien does.

These medications are commonly used to treat anxiety and depression, and they can help improve focus, mood, and overall well-being. They are generally considered safe and well-tolerated, and they have a long track record of effectiveness.\n\nAnother option might be a beta blocker like propranolol. This medication is commonly used to treat high blood pressure, but it can also help reduce anxiety and improve focus. It works by blocking the physical symptoms of anxiety, like rapid heartbeat and trembling, and it can be a useful addition to other therapies.\n\nFinally, you might consider talking to a therapist about cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). This type of therapy can help you identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to your anxiety.

For example, you mentioned that you know you get anxious when you're around your wife's family or your own family, but you also mentioned that you eat like a pig when you're at home alone. This might suggest that there's something specific about being in a social situation that's triggering your anxiety.\n\nOne approach might be to break down the problem into smaller, more manageable steps. For example, you could start by identifying the specific triggers that cause your anxiety when you're in a social situation. Is it the pressure of being around others? The fear of embarrassing yourself? Once you have a better understanding of what's causing your anxiety, you might be able to develop a plan to address each of these triggers.\n\nAdditionally, you might consider seeking support from friends or family members. Talking through your feelings and getting perspective from others can be a powerful way to gain control over your anxiety. You might also consider practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, to help you manage your anxiety in the moment.\n\nRemember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed by this issue, but don't let that stop you from taking small steps towards solving it. By breaking down the problem into manageable parts and taking things one step at a time, you can find a way to overcome your anxiety and enjoy meals and social events without feeling anxious or overwhelmed.

Even when they're generally nice and good to me, this instance of being negative affects me to the point where I cannot see anything but it and not feel anything for them but... aversion? \n\nMaybe it's possible to go through life and avoid such people altogether, but I'm sure there are situations where you somehow just have to deal with it, being in a relationship at times or maybe in a workplace environment or with family members. \n\nI've asked him to stop many times, it's gotten better, a bit, but I don't think he'll ever stop, and I cannot control him or other people, so I'd like to find a way to control it within myself.

What you value may not always be suitable depending on the situation, and communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with your beliefs. However, if the situation contradicts your beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others' perspectives.\n\nFor example, if you firmly believe that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. But, be aware that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\nHere are a few tips for reappraising the situation and managing your own emotions:\n\n1. Practice empathy: Try to understand where the other person is coming from and why they might be feeling a certain way.\n2. Take a step back: When you feel yourself getting overwhelmed, take a break and do something that helps you relax.\n3. Reframe the situation: Instead of viewing the other person's behavior as a personal attack, try to see it as a sign that they are struggling with something.\n4. Set boundaries: If someone's behavior is consistently causing you stress, it may be necessary to set boundaries or distance yourself from the situation.\n\nRemember, it's okay to have different values and beliefs from others, and it's important to respect and acknowledge those differences. By practicing empathy and reappraising the situation, you can learn to manage your emotions and respond in a more constructive way.\"", "evaluation_raw_output_dim_23": "4"}

Reflect on past successes: Remember the times you've successfully performed in front of an audience before. Those experiences can help build confidence and prove that you're capable of handling this situation.\n2. Focus on the present moment: Instead of worrying about the future or past, focus on the present moment. Be fully engaged in the performance and enjoy the experience.\n3. Reframe negative thoughts: Challenge any negative self-talk or catastrophic thoughts with more balanced and realistic ones. For example, instead of thinking \"I'm going to bomb,\" try \"I'm prepared and capable of handling this.\"\n4. Practice mindfulness: Take deep breaths and pay attention to your body. Mindfulness can help calm your nerves and center you in the present moment.\n5. Embrace imperfection: Remember that Improv is all about being spontaneous and flexible.

So you're feeling nervous about your upcoming Improv performance, huh? Well, let me tell you something - you've got this! You've done this before, and you've been doing it for 7 years now. You're not just a high school graduate, you're a seasoned Improv performer.\n\nSo, let's break this down into manageable steps. What's the first thing that's making you feel nervous? Is it the fear of bombing? Okay, let's tackle that one. Ask yourself this - do you have control over the outcome of the performance? The answer is no. You can't control how the audience will react or how well you'll do, but you can control how you prepare for it.\n\nSo, here's what you do. Make a to-do list of things you need to do to prepare for the performance. Start with the things that are in your control, like rehearsing your lines, practicing your timing, and getting a good night's sleep. Break each of those tasks down into smaller, more manageable steps. For example, instead of just \"rehearsing your lines,\" break it down into \"memorize 5 lines today, 5 lines tomorrow, and so on.\"\n\nNow, here's the important part - focus on the task at hand. Don't worry about the outcome, just focus on the process. Find joy in striking off items from your to-do list. With each task you complete, you'll feel more empowered and in control. And before you know it, you'll be up on that stage, performing like a pro and loving every minute of it.\n\nOh, and one more thing - don't be afraid to ask for support. Your friends and family are there to help you, so don't hesitate to reach out if you need it. They can provide a listening ear, help you practice your lines, or just be a sounding board for your nerves.\n\nSo, there you have it! You've got this, and you're going to crush it tonight.

You have the skills and experience to handle this performance with ease.\n\nSo, ask yourself: What's the worst that could happen? Will it really be the end of the world if you make a few mistakes or forget a line? Probably not. And if you do bomb, so what? It's not a reflection of your worth as a person.\n\nNow, focus on what you can control. Take a few deep breaths, visualize yourself nailing the performance, and remember why you wanted to do this in the first place.

If you work for an employer they normally work out how much tax etc you owe and it's deducted at source so what you get in your pay check is yours. But if you're self employed you have to fill in a tax return each year. You can fill in the return from the 6th April and it has to be done by 31st January the following year.

It takes time to find people you click with, and it's okay if you don't have a ton of friends yet.\n\nOne thing that might be helpful is to stop putting so much pressure on yourself to make friends. Instead of trying to find fake friends just to party with, try focusing on finding people who share your interests and values.

Even if you don't become best friends with them, it's a good way to start building connections and meeting new people.\n\nLastly, try not to compare yourself to others too much. It's easy to feel like everyone around you has a big group of friends and a busy social life, but that's probably not the case. Most people are just as nervous and uncertain as you are, and they're just trying to figure things out too.

As a result, many people are fearing that COVID-19 restrictions will be constantly looming over us for the rest of human history, persistently drifting in and out of our lives. I'd like to explain why these fears simply are not rational. Despite what some say, Israel has not achieved herd immunity. They are very close, of course, but they are not at that milestone *yet.* About 5,160,000 Israelis are fully vaccinated, equivalent to roughly 56% of the Israeli population is fully vaccinated. Add that to all the Israelis who have attained natural immunity from the virus, and the percentage rate of immunity within Israel arrives at roughly 66%. For a group to have herd immunity to COVID-19, 70% must be immune. Because Israel has yet to achieve herd immunity, it is still possible for an outbreak to take place. Even with this in mind, the outbreak Israel has been facing is minuscule compared to the size of outbreaks at any point in 2020.

This means that it is still possible for outbreaks to occur, but the likelihood is lower.\n2. Current outbreak is minuscule: Compared to the outbreaks in 2020, the current outbreak in Israel is relatively small. This suggests that the measures taken so far have been effective in containing the spread of the virus.\n3. Vaccination efforts are ongoing: The Israeli government is continuing to vaccinate the population, and the number of fully vaccinated individuals is increasing. This will further reduce the risk of outbreaks.\n4. Focus on what you can control: Instead of worrying about things that are outside of your control, focus on what you can do to contribute to the effort against COVID-19.

While it is true that there have been some reported cases of deaths following vaccination, the scientific consensus is that these cases are extremely rare and are not directly caused by the vaccine.\n\nIt is also important to note that the risk of death from COVID-19 is significantly higher than the risk of death from the vaccine. According to the World Health Organization, the risk of death from COVID-19 is approximately 0.5-1% for individuals who are not vaccinated, while the risk of death from the AstraZeneca vaccine is approximately 0.00002-0.00004% (or 2-4 deaths per 100,000 doses administered).\n\nGiven this information, it may be helpful for the narrator to reappraise the situation and consider the following options:\n\n1.

Specifically those in first world countries, in relation to how it affects us on a psychological level. As people, we tend to experience bad things as happening suddenly, all at once, and then you deal with them. A broken leg, a car wreak, getting fired, getting dumped, etc. Deeply unpleasant, but relatively short-duration things. These are type-1 and type-2 problems; Things which can be avoided, or which can be fixed. But the Coronavirus has loaded us all down with the third type of problem. The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part.

I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to keep this up. The possibility of a variant wave in the Fall, forcing us back into yet another lockdown, terrifies me. I can't relax, I can't focus, and it's been seven or eight months since I've had any meaningful hope for the future.

{"Reddit ID": "obufss", "Reddit Post": "Hi Folks, Hope y'all have been doing well. I'm from Germany, and I'm well, pretty worried about Delta Variant. I (22f) got my first shot of Biontech last week and so did my sister. My mom is fully vaccinated with Moderna. My stepdad received his first shot of Biontech two days ago. But we also have two kids (age 5 and 3) in our family. Obviously they can't get vaccinated. Hearing that Delta is very transmissible, and often even infects vaccinated folk, scares me. I know efficiency of the vaccines was never 100% but I believed at least we'd be safe from Covid when we get vaccinated. I work full-time and go to school. At school, everyone wears a mask, we are 1,5m apart, the windows are open and everyone gets tested daily. At work, my coworker wears a mask and so do I. When I eat or drink I go outside. Otherwise, I don't take off my mask at all (I wear FFP2 or FFP3). My boss doesn't wear a mask but he only occasionally comes into our office. Also, everyone at my work place had Corona three months ago except me. They caught Alpha (B117). I also have to take public transit. Everyone wears masks. Windows are open. How big is my risk of infection? I have been getting regularly tested since March 21 (1 to 4 times a week) and it came back negative all the time, even when we had a high national incidence and infection was more likely. National incidence is now 5 cases per 100.000 people. In my town it is 3 cases per 100.000 people. At the moment, we have 49 active cases (my town is huge; 500.000 people live here). Do I really have to be worried? I even wear my ffp2 mask when I walk my dog. When I am fully vaccinated, what safety measures should I still follow?

Hypochondria can cause us to focus on potential health problems and blow them out of proportion, which can lead to more anxiety and stress.\n\nTo help you manage your negative emotions and reduce your anxiety, here are a few strategies you might find helpful:\n\n1. Practice deep breathing exercises: When we're feeling anxious or stressed, our breathing can become shallow and rapid. By taking slow, deep breaths, you can help calm your body and mind.\n2. Engage in physical activity: Exercise can help reduce stress and anxiety by releasing endorphins, which are natural mood-boosters. Even a short walk or some light stretching can be beneficial.\n3. Challenge negative thoughts: When you start to feel anxious or worried, try to challenge those thoughts by asking yourself if they're based in reality. Remind yourself of the facts about the vaccine and the low risk of serious side effects.\n4. Seek out support: Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional about your fears and concerns. Sometimes just sharing our feelings with someone who cares about us can help us feel better and gain perspective.\n5. Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness involves being present in the moment and focusing on our thoughts, feelings, and sensations without judgment.

The narrator can consider masks with a high particulate filtration efficiency (e.g., 99%) to protect against both viruses and particles.\n2. Particle size: The typical COVID-19 aerosol size is around 0.3 micrometers, but the narrator should not stress too much about this detail. A high-quality mask with a good filtration efficiency will provide adequate protection regardless of the particle size.\n3. Mask selection: The narrator can explore different mask options, such as N95, N100, or surgical masks, and choose one that fits their needs and preferences. It's important to prioritize a mask that fits snugly over the nose and mouth to minimize air leaks.\n4. Valve closure: Closing the valve with a solid object is not necessary, as it may compromise the mask's filtration efficiency. Instead, the narrator can focus on properly wearing the mask, ensuring it covers their nose and mouth, and avoiding touching the mask while wearing it.\n5.

For example, you could focus on researching potential mandates, talking to your employer about their plans, and preparing a budget for any potential expenses.\n2. Develop a detailed plan: Once you have broken down the problem, create a detailed plan for each task. This will help you feel more in control and prepared for any changes that may come your way.\n3. Seek support: If you are feeling overwhelmed, don't be afraid to reach out to friends and family for support. Talking through your concerns with someone you trust can help you feel more grounded and in control.\n4. Focus on the task at hand: Instead of getting bogged down by the scope of the issue, focus on the task you have narrowed down on your to-do list. Take pride in striking off items as you complete them, and remember that each accomplishment brings you one step closer to a resolution.\n\nRemember, taking control of a situation doesn't mean you have to have all the answers or solutions. It simply means you are taking proactive steps to prepare and navigate the situation to the best of your ability. By breaking down the problem into manageable steps, seeking support, and focusing on the task at hand, you can take control of the situation and feel more empowered.", "evaluation_raw_output_dim_4": 4, "reappraisal_output_dim_6": "Based on the information provided, it is unlikely that governors in the US will mandate expensive tests for the vaccinated to cross state lines or shut down all restaurants this fall/winter.

Practice self-care: Take care of yourself physically, emotionally, and mentally. Get enough sleep, exercise regularly, and engage in activities that bring you joy and relaxation.\n4. Seek support: Talk to friends, family, or a therapist about your concerns and feelings. Sharing your emotions with others can help you feel heard and understood, and can provide a different perspective on the situation.\n5. Set boundaries: Establish boundaries with others to protect your time and energy. Learn to say \"no\" to things that drain your energy or cause you stress.\n\nRemember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed and uncertain.

I'm struggling so much at the moment with having any sort of hope for the future. It just feels like we will never get normality back. COVID has completely ruined me. I went from being a (mostly) happy and functional human to depressed and suicidal since 2020. I take anti depressants now and I started therapy but even on my good days, I still feel like there's this dark cloud over my head and I'm waiting for the next shitstorm. I live in the UK and we've had three long lockdowns. Everything was looking pretty hopeful a few months ago, but since the last lockdown rules started easing, cases and hospitalisations have started rising again, even though we're doing pretty well with vaccinations. Our Government have handled the pandemic pretty poorly throughout and managed to let the Delta variant in with their loose border control measures. It just feels like this never ending cycle of rising cases, lockdown, falling cases, lift lockdown, rising cases again, etc etc and I'm terrified of going into another lockdown in the Autumn. I can't do it again. We keep saying the lockdowns are to protect our (underfunded) NHS from being overwhelmed but if hospitalisations are already getting too high now in the SUMMER, how the hell will they cope with a Winter wave with not only COVID cases but also a new wave of Flu cases which have been low the last year because of the lockdowns??? I feel guilty for complaining as I know other people have it much worse, and having already had the virus, it's not affected me all that badly. But the restrictions have meant I can no longer do my job (musician), I can't meet a partner, I've lost all hope for the future and I just feel like I'm waiting for the next bit of bad news.

They are not in great health and my father-in-law specifically is older and I worry about his health. Therefore, even as things have started to open up, my family has been relatively more conservative, with no masks-free indoor interaction outside of the family, even with people that are vaccinated, for fear of spreading the virus to my inlaws.

From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to. I feel like I've become so negative that I don't want to share my thoughts with people because I will bring them down, and I already feel like I pushed some people away by doing this. I emailed multiple psychiatrists, but only one answered me and had one short appointment, and told me I should continue looking because he doesn't have time for new patients.

This can be a common trap that many of us fall into, especially when we're feeling overwhelmed or uncertain about our role in a given situation.\n\nHere's the thing: you don't have to take on all of the responsibility for everything that happens. It's okay to recognize your limits and boundaries, and to only take on what you can reasonably handle. In fact, taking on too much responsibility can be harmful and lead to burnout.\n\nSo, here's what I suggest: take a step back and assess the situation objectively. Ask yourself, \"What am I actually responsible for here?\" and \"What can I realistically handle?\" By doing so, you may find that there are certain aspects of the situation that you don't need to worry about as much as you thought.\n\nAdditionally, it might be helpful to practice self-compassion and self-care. Remember that you're doing the best you can, and that it's okay to make mistakes and ask for help when you need it.\n\nLastly, if you feel like you're not taking on enough responsibility and want to make a change, you could try setting some specific, achievable goals for yourself.

You can't control how others feel about breastfeeding, but you can control how you respond to the situation. Instead of getting hung up on whether the barista had the right to make the request, let's focus on finding a solution that works for you and your infant.\n\nHere are some manageable steps you can take:\n\n1. Check the store's policy: Look for the store's policy on breastfeeding and see if it's explicitly stated that you need to use the Family Room. If it's not in the policy, you may want to consider speaking with the store owner or manager to understand their perspective.\n2. Talk to the barista: If you haven't already, you could speak with the barista and ask them to clarify their reasoning for asking you to use the Family Room. They may have a valid reason that you're not aware of.\n3. Consider other options: If you're not comfortable using the Family Room, you could ask if there's another area where you can breastfeed. Perhaps there's a quiet corner or a designated breastfeeding area.\n4. Seek support: If you feel overwhelmed or unsure about how to proceed, consider reaching out to a friend or family member for support. They may be able to offer a different perspective or provide emotional support.\n\nRemember, you have the right to breastfeed your infant in a safe and clean environment. If you feel that the Family Room is not a suitable option, you can politely decline and ask for an alternative.\n\nRemember to focus on the task at hand, and don't be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue.

Most children naturally stop using pacifiers around 2-4 years old, but some may still be using them at 5 or 6 years old.\n\nYou've described your daughter as being \"semi-attached\" to the pacifier, which is a good starting point for weaning. Since she only uses it for sleeping and occasional play, you can start by limiting the times when she can use it. Here's a gradual weaning plan you can try:\n\n1. Start by taking the pacifier away during naps, and only offer it at bedtime.\n2. After a week or two, stop offering the pacifier at bedtime, and only let her use it if she wakes up during the night.\n3. Once she's consistently sleeping through the night without the pacifier, you can start phasing it out during playtime.\n\nIt's important to be consistent and patient, as weaning can take time. Don't be too hard on yourself or your daughter if she resists or has trouble adjusting. Remember, it's okay to make mistakes and adjust your approach as needed.\n\nCold turkey may not be the best approach for your daughter, as it can be too abrupt and lead to more resistance.

However, you can encourage her to take responsibility for her own actions and belongings by setting clear expectations and consequences. For example, you can explain that the pacifier is a special item that she needs to take care of, and if she loses it, she won't be able to use it anymore.\n\nOverall, weaning your daughter off the pacifier is a gradual process that requires patience, consistency, and understanding.

This can help your daughter adjust to not having the pacifier during other times of the day.\n\nAnother strategy is to offer a replacement comfort object, such as a stuffed animal or blanket, to help your daughter transition away from the pacifier. This can provide her with a familiar object to comfort herself when she needs it.\n\nIt's also essential to be consistent in your approach and to communicate with your daughter about what you're doing.

She would play with her toys for a little bit after we put her down (which is a given, room+toys.. UH YEA!) then she would pass out. Recently she has started to just.. not go to sleep until at least 11;30 at night. It is driving us batty! \nShe gets one simple, not very long nap a day to keep her from tearing up the house. It was two naps until she wouldn't sleep at all. Now, it is like she doesn't want to sleep with the one nap! But, if we keep her up she is like a monkey in a tiny cage. Her dad has told me to stop letting her nap, but I need it to 1. keep my sanity, 2. actually get things done.. and the list goes on.\nHave any of you had experience with this?

While it's understandable to want your child to sleep through the night, it's important to remember that it's normal for toddlers to have varying sleep schedules and to resist sleep at times.\n\nHere are a few things to keep in mind:\n\n1. Your daughter's sleep needs may be different from what you expected. Toddlers this age often need more sleep than they did as infants, and they may still be developing their sleep skills.\n2. It's okay if your daughter doesn't sleep through the night every night. In fact, most toddlers don't sleep through the night consistently until they're around 3-4 years old.\n3. Instead of focusing on getting your daughter to sleep through the night, try to focus on establishing a consistent bedtime routine that works for your family. This can include reading a book, singing a lullaby, or having a warm bath.\n4. It's also important to make sure your daughter is getting enough physical activity and stimulation during the day, as this can help her sleep better at night.\n\nIn terms of your daughter's naps, it's not uncommon for toddlers to resist napping as they get older. If she's only taking one nap a day, that may be enough for her. Instead of trying to force her to take two naps, you could try to find other ways to keep her engaged and active during the day.\n\nRemember, it's okay if your daughter doesn't sleep as much as you would like her to.

I hear you're feeling overwhelmed with your toddler's new sleeping habits and lack of naps. Let's break this down into manageable steps, shall we? \ud83d\ude0a\n\nFirst, let's focus on what you can control. You mentioned your daughter is now sleeping later and later, but you still have some control over her daily routine. Here's what you can do:\n\n1. Keep her bedtime routine consistent: Stick to the same bedtime and wake-up time every day, even on weekends. This helps regulate her body clock and can improve the quality of her sleep.\n2. Offer a calming pre-bedtime activity: Try a soothing bath, reading a book, or singing a lullaby to help her wind down before bed.\n3. Limit screen time before bed: Avoid exposing her to screens (e.g., phones, tablets, TVs) at least an hour before bedtime, as the blue light emitted can interfere with her sleep.\n4. Make her bedroom sleep-friendly: Ensure her bedroom is dark, quiet, and at a comfortable temperature.\n\nNow, let's tackle the issue of her not wanting to sleep during the day. Here are some ideas:\n\n1. Offer a morning nap: If she's resisting sleep during the day, try offering a short morning nap (20-30 minutes) to help her recharge.\n2. Create a rest time: Instead of napping, establish a \"rest time\" in the afternoon where she can relax and wind down with a book or a quiet activity.\n3. Gradually reduce rest time: As she adjusts to this new routine, you can gradually reduce the duration of her rest time.\n\nRemember, it's essential to be patient and consistent when introducing these changes. It may take some time for your daughter to adjust, but with a clear plan and a supportive network (friends, family, or a sleep consultant), you can help her develop healthy sleep habits. \ud83d\udca4\n\nDon't be too hard on yourself, and remember to take breaks when needed.

It sounds like you're dealing with a common challenge of parenting: finding the balance between giving your child the sleep they need and keeping them from getting overtired.\n\nFirst, let's take a step back and assess whether this situation is worth your attention. Is your daughter's resistance to sleep affecting her daily life or causing significant distress for you and your family? If the answer is no, it may not be worth devoting too much energy to solving this issue.\n\nHowever, if the situation is causing problems, there are a few things you could try to make bedtime easier. For example, you could establish a consistent bedtime routine that includes winding down activities, like reading a book or singing a lullaby. You could also try limiting screen time before bed and making sure the bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool.\n\nIt's also important to remember that children often resist sleep because they're not tired enough. So, if your daughter is still playing with toys or jumping around at bedtime, it may be worth waiting a bit longer before trying to put her down.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you to decide what's most important to focus on. If you're feeling overwhelmed by your daughter's sleep habits, it may be helpful to prioritize self-care and find ways to manage your own stress.

Is it the lack of sleep, the feeling of being controlled by your daughter's needs, or something else? Once you can identify the source of your upset, you may be able to come up with strategies to manage those feelings and regain some control over your life.\n\nAdditionally, have you considered talking to your daughter's pediatrician about this situation?

Children at this age are naturally curious and energetic, and they often push boundaries to see how far they can go.\n\nTo reappraise the situation, you might consider the following options:\n\n1. Set clear boundaries and consistency: Establish a consistent bedtime routine and stick to it, even on weekends. This can help your daughter learn to self-soothe and wind down at night.\n2. Offer choices and involve her in the process: Allow your daughter to choose between two or three sleep-related activities, such as reading a book or singing a lullaby. This can give her a sense of control and agency.\n3. Make the bedtime routine fun: Add some fun elements to the bedtime routine, such as a special song or a stuffed animal. This can help make bedtime more enjoyable for your daughter.\n4. Gradually phase out the nap: If your daughter is resisting the nap, you might consider gradually phasing it out over the next few weeks. Start by reducing the nap by 15-30 minutes each day, and see how your daughter adjusts.\n5. Seek support: Don't be afraid to reach out to your partner, close friends, or family members for support.

Use hand sanitizer: Keep a small bottle of hand sanitizer with you and use it frequently, especially after touching your baby or surfaces that may have germs.\n3.

Keep your baby's toys clean: Wash your baby's toys regularly, especially those that are frequently mouthed or handled by strangers.\n5. Be mindful of crowded areas: Try to avoid taking your baby to crowded areas, especially during peak cold and flu season.\n6. Set boundaries: It's okay to politely decline attention from strangers if it becomes too overwhelming. You can do this by saying something like, \"Thank you so much for your interest, but we're trying to finish our meal/get our baby to sleep/etc.\"\n\nRemember, it's okay to ask for support from friends and family if you feel overwhelmed by the situation. Together, you can come up with a plan to manage the attention and protect your baby's health.\n\nDon't be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue.

Practice assertive boundaries: You can politely decline or limit interactions with strangers, especially during mealtime or when your daughter needs a moment to rest.\n2.

Instead of relying on a set of rigid rules or expectations, it's important to be flexible and adaptable, and to communicate openly and honestly with your partner and child.\n\nOne piece of advice that I would offer is to prioritize open and honest communication with your partner about your values, beliefs, and parenting style. This can help you navigate any conflicts or misunderstandings that may arise, and ensure that you are both on the same page when it comes to raising your child.\n\nAdditionally, it may be helpful to seek out support from other fathers or father figures who can offer guidance and advice based on their own experiences. This can help you gain a broader perspective on fatherhood and provide you with a sense of community and connection with other parents who may be going through similar challenges.\n\nUltimately, the most important thing is to be present, engaged, and loving towards your child, and to prioritize their well-being and happiness above all else.

{"Reddit ID": "laqpo", "Reddit Post": "My wife is a stay at home mom, but our 3 year old is at a private Montessori preschool 4 days a week, 8 hours a day. Is this too much at that age?

While it's understandable to want the best for your child, it's important to consider the developmentally appropriate amount of time for a child of her age.\n\nResearch suggests that children at the age of 3-4 years old benefit from a balance of both structured and unstructured playtime. Full-day preschool programs can be beneficial for socialization and learning, but it's also important to ensure that your child has enough time for free play, rest, and family time.\n\nIt's worth considering the following guidelines for preschool attendance:\n\n1. Age-appropriate attendance: Children at the age of 3-4 years old should attend preschool for a minimum of 2-3 hours per day, with a maximum of 4-5 hours per day.\n2. Balance with free play: Ensure that your child has enough time for unstructured play, both at home and in school. This will help them develop their social and emotional skills.\n3. Adjust based on needs: Consider your child's individual needs and adjust their preschool schedule accordingly. If they seem overwhelmed or unhappy, it may be necessary to reduce their attendance.\n4. Prioritize family time: Make sure your child has enough time for family bonding and activities, such as mealtime, storytime, and outdoor play.\n\nRemember, every child is unique, and what works for one family may not work for another.

Set clear boundaries: If the narrator decides to give the iPod touch back, it's important to set clear boundaries and expectations for its use. This can include limiting the times of day it can be used, setting screen time limits, and monitoring its usage.\n3. Earn it back: As the narrator mentioned, the son could earn the iPod touch back by demonstrating responsibility. This could involve completing chores or tasks, showing good grades, or demonstrating good behavior over a set period of time.\n4. Monitor usage: Even if the narrator decides to give the iPod touch back, it's important to monitor its usage to ensure it's not being used inappropriately.

{"Reddit ID": "qir67", "Reddit Post": "Hello, All~\n\nI've been invited to China for a month this summer (all of July) to teach English to middle school students and establish rapport with our \"sister city\" in XinJin.  My 8-year old son and 6-year old daughter may accompany me - they would be with a nanny 4-5 hours a day while I teach, and then we would have evenings/weekends to explore the city/country/etc.  \n\nThis is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me, and possibly my children, but I'm having anxiety...I need help convincing myself to do it.  Please help.  \n\nThings I'm worried about:\n\nFood - my children are picky eaters.  We could start experimenting with foods for the next few months.  \n\nTransportation - should we bring scooters?  Buy bicycles?  We currently live outside of Denver, \"entertainment\" - we live in a house, with a dog and a yard.  In China, we will live in a hotel.\n\nMeltdowns - my almost-6-year old had a major meltdown last night. \nI realized that she was hungry and tired, but as a single parent, I'm worried that the stress of being in a foreign country will put my right over the edge.

Here are some suggestions to help you reappraise the situation:\n\n1. Food: While it's understandable that your children are picky eaters, it's unlikely that they will starve in China. Many restaurants in tourist areas cater to foreigners and offer a variety of Western dishes. You can also explore local cuisine and introduce your children to new flavors. Packing snacks and comfort foods from home can also help.\n2. Transportation: Scooters and bicycles may not be the best options in China, as the traffic can be chaotic, and the language barrier may make it difficult to communicate with locals. Instead, consider public transportation like buses and subways, which are widely available and relatively affordable. You can also look into hiring a driver or a car service for longer trips.\n3. Meltdowns: It's normal for children to have meltdowns, especially when they are in a new and unfamiliar environment. Packing comfort items and having a plan for managing tantrums can help. Additionally, exposing your children to new experiences and environments can help them develop resilience and adaptability.\n4. Language barrier: While it's true that China has a different language and culture, many Chinese people, especially younger generations, speak some English. Additionally, there are many English-speaking locals in tourist areas. You can also download translation apps on your phone to help communicate.\n5. Safety: China is generally a safe country, but as with any travel, it's important to take precautions. Make sure your children are aware of basic safety rules, such as not talking to strangers or accepting food or drinks from strangers.\n\nIn conclusion, while there may be some challenges to traveling with children in China, it can also be an incredible experience for all of you. Instead of focusing on the potential downsides, try to approach the trip with an open mind and a sense of adventure.
