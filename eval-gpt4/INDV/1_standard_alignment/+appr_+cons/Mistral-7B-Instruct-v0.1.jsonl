They're millennials.\"\n\nI said it in a joking way. Like 100% I was kidding and I meant it as a playful jab at millennials in general. Not just my parents. But my mom got offended and talked to me about it, and I thought about how this shit ALWAYS FUCKING HAPPENS AND I CANT FUCKING STAND IT I WANT TO FUCKING DIE IF IT MEANS THERES A CHANCE I CAN BE SOMEONE ELSE I FUCKING HATE BEING ME!!! Well she fucking took it up the ass like I said and then I got upset and started manically explaining how I didn't mean it like that and how I wasn't the one who ruined the night. (Maybe I was just trying to convince myself).\n\nIt just happened again right now and I'm crying as I'm typing. This shit happens all the time.

I had anger issues in kindergarten and in elementary school and have been to a psychologist in second grade because my situation was that bad. Nowadays, the issues are much worse, I have lots of stress on me currently with online school and all kinds of things related to it, I am very tired because I am also not getting enough sleep.\n\nWhenever I get angry, I usually just have to smash whatever it is in my hand (controller, pen, notebook etc) against the surface that is closest to me, let it be my desk or bed. This has not only caused me and my family hundreds of dollars of damages, but I also usually get hurt in the process. Sure, wounds can heal, but having them in the first place because of a mental breakdown because my pen has dried out is a pretty fucked up thing in my book. \n\nI tried putting said things down before starting to hit something, but I just have zero self control and can't consistently do so. I also tried calming myself down by just staying still and doing nothing, but that usually gets me even more angry and I cause more harm to myself. I tried hitting other things like my pillows, but that causes almost the same effect as staying still. And after I break something I get sober and realize what I just did and get a bad feeling of doom or whatever that is.\n\nIs there any way I can at the very least minimize these breakouts?

Hi I have social anxiety and I was wondering, there's this girl that occasionally walks past me in the hallway and we were classmates for one year in a class and I have tried to initiate contact with her. She actually said she liked me 2 years prior (we have 1.5 years of online school), but I ghosted her which was very dumb and entirely my fault. I have miserably failed because of my social anxiety around her. My heart races and my mind goes blank with hesitation every time I'm around her. I haven't really talked to her for 2 years, so I am thinking that I would come off as a creep if I were to talk to her. And she typically walks at a 4mph rate, with arms crossed, looking down, so I don't really know if randomly saying hello would come off as weird or not, or if she doesn't even see me.

I have been to counseling, which helped slightly, I am on anxiety medicine too since counseling did not help enough. Even with anxiety medicine, I still struggle with anxiety and because of it, depression. My anxiety medicine seems to have bad side effects, like no sex drive, super irregular periods, tiredness, night sweats. I would say it slightly helps but I also wonder sometimes if it is just a placebo affect in my mind.\n\n I struggle to work, be social or anything \"normal\" people do.

New poster so I apologize for any mistakes! \n\nI've been dealing with anxiety and panic attacks since I was in middle school, and I know that they are caused by abandonment issues, as well as some insecurities. I know exactly what my triggers are, why they happen and what specific fear is causing them....so for the most part I have been able to manage it without medication or therapy. Unfortunately, things began to peak two years ago during the beginning of covid and my stress and anxiety ended up actually causing shingles. After this, and getting covid, a few other random symptoms began to occur during major anxiety episodes. These still happen to this day, when it gets bad enough, but doctors have assured me these symptoms are my \"post covid norm now\". A lot happened in that time to cause it, so it wasn't one specific trigger like it used to be. Ever since, I have had a much more difficult time controlling the spiraling that occurs once the thoughts creep in.

{"Reddit ID": "Anxiety_111", "Reddit Post": "Just wanted to share with someone that I filed my tax return all on my own!\n\nFor those outside England a quick simplified brief on our tax system.  If you work for an employer they normally work out how much tax etc you owe and it's deducted at source so what you get in your pay check is yours. But if you're self employed you have to fill in a tax return each year. You can fill in the return from the 6th April and it has to be done by 31st January the following year. So the tax return I've just submitted is for tax year 2020-2021.\n\nI hate doing my tax return. My accounts are really simple, profits easy to calculate and very few expenses. But I'm so paranoid I'll do something wrong. There's so many different fields to fill in and I have no clue what half of them mean. I've always asked my sister to sit with me in the past when I do my returns but this year I did it all on my own.\n\nTo further complicate matters my accounts last year are screwed up because of coronavirus. My income was down ~75% but I was eligible for a government support scheme called the Self Employment Income Support Scheme. However I then had to declare all these figures on my tax returns which was even more boxes to tick.\n\nI also had to claim my fifth grant which means working out my turnover for the last two years etc. and freaking out that I'll somehow claim the wrong amount or screw something up.\n\nIt took me two weeks of staring at the folder to build up the courage and then about half an hour ago I finally hit that sweet spot of the anxiety of not doing it outweighing the anxiety of doing it (the grant deadline is September). So here I am just after midnight waiting for the anxiety adrenaline rush to die down so I can actually get some sleep.\n\nBut I did it! I just needed to share with someone as I'm really proud of myself.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_anxiety", "Model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", "reappraisal_output_dim_1": "Based on the analysis above, it appears that the narrator is feeling anxious about completing their tax return, but they do not explicitly state that they feel responsible for causing the situation.

{"Reddit ID": "o7lkru", "Reddit Post": "Recently, the Israeli government reinstituted its indoor mask mandate after about 300 Israelis were diagnosed with COVID-19. As a result, many people are fearing that COVID-19 restrictions will be constantly looming over us for the rest of human history, persistently drifting in and out of our lives. I'd like to explain why these fears simply are not rational. Despite what some say, Israel has not achieved herd immunity. They are very close, of course, but they are not at that milestone *yet.* About 5,160,000 Israelis are fully vaccinated, equivalent to roughly 56% of the Israeli population is fully vaccinated. Add that to all the Israelis who have attained natural immunity from the virus, and the percentage rate of immunity within Israel arrives at roughly 66%. For a group to have herd immunity to COVID-19, 70% must be immune. Because Israel has yet to achieve herd immunity, it is still possible for an outbreak to take place. Even with this in mind, the outbreak Israel has been facing is minuscule compared to the size of outbreaks at any point in 2020. Additionally, many of the people infected are kids, of whom the Israeli medical establishment has only vaccinated a small amount.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_covid19_support", "Model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", "reappraisal_output_dim_1": "<likert>NA</likert><rationale>The text does not address the extent to which the narrator thought they were responsible for causing the situation.</rationale> \n\nBased on the analysis above, it is important for the narrator to understand that their fears about COVID-19 restrictions constantly looming over them are not rational.

{"Reddit ID": "o93rqd", "Reddit Post": "Hey, everyone, just in a particularly dark patch, and feeling the need for some dialogue. I've been doing a lot of thinking, lately, and I think I've finally got a handle on why the pandemic has been so chronically stressful for me, and others, over the past year. Specifically those in first world countries, in relation to how it affects us on a psychological level. As people, we tend to experience bad things as happening suddenly, all at once, and then you deal with them. A broken leg, a car wreak, getting fired, getting dumped, etc. Deeply unpleasant, but relatively short-duration things. These are type-1 and type-2 problems; Things which can be avoided, or which can be fixed. But the Coronavirus has loaded us all down with the third type of problem. The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part. Lots of us weren't doing too great before the pandemic hit, but then, after 15 months of slow, grinding lockdowns, endless bad news on top of bad news, and nowhere to go to get away from it... Is it really a wonder why everyone is so unhappy all the time? I feel like a machine that's trying harder and harder to run without lubricant, to the point that it's just scraping metal-on-metal, and every day is a bit harder than the last. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to keep this up. The possibility of a variant wave in the Fall, forcing us back into yet another lockdown, terrifies me. I can't relax, I can't focus, and it's been seven or eight months since I've had any meaningful hope for the future. This late in the game, I just... can't shake the feeling that things will never get better. 2019 was the best things will ever be in my lifetime, and it's all downhill from here.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_covid19_support", "Model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", "reappraisal_output_dim_1": "<likert>NA</likert><rationale>The text does not address the extent to which the narrator thought they were responsible for causing the situation.</rationale>\n\nIt's understandable that the narrator is feeling overwhelmed and stressed by the pandemic.

For example, we can control our own thoughts and emotions, and we can take steps to take care of our physical and mental health. We can also control how we react to the things that are outside of our control, such as the pandemic. Instead of dwelling on things that we can't change, we can focus on the things that we can do to make the best of the situation.\n\nIt's also important to remember that it's okay to ask for help if we need it.

I (22f) got my first shot of Biontech last week and so did my sister. My mom is fully vaccinated with Moderna. My stepdad received his first shot of Biontech two days ago. But we also have two kids (age 5 and 3) in our family. Obviously they can't get vaccinated. Hearing that Delta is very transmissible, and often even infects vaccinated folk, scares me. I know efficiency of the vaccines was never 100% but I believed at least we'd be safe from Covid when we get vaccinated. I work full-time and go to school. At school, everyone wears a mask, we are 1,5m apart, the windows are open and everyone gets tested daily. At work, my coworker wears a mask and so do I. When I eat or drink I go outside. Otherwise, I don't take off my mask at all (I wear FFP2 or FFP3). My boss doesn't wear a mask but he only occasionally comes into our office. Also, everyone at my work place had Corona three months ago except me. They caught Alpha (B117). I also have to take public transit. Everyone wears masks. Windows are open. How big is my risk of infection? I have been getting regularly tested since March 21 (1 to 4 times a week) and it came back negative all the time, even when we had a high national incidence and infection was more likely. National incidence is now 5 cases per 100.000 people. In my town it is 3 cases per 100.000 people. At the moment, we have 49 active cases (my town is huge; 500.000 people live here).

Very few countries are exempt from this, almost entirely small islands around the world. Meanwhile Denmark's infection numbers have doubled, yay European football events. So the hopes of ever getting on the UK's green list are smaller and smaller. I have since the start of this whole thing been worrying about loved ones.

It has been almost a full year since I saw a single family member, more than a year for many of them. And not even a glimmer of hope.

FWIW, I also live thousands of miles from all of my family. My anxiety got pretty bad several months ago during the holidays when Covid was at its peak and was impossible to see people. I was also still furloughed from work and had a lot of time to think (and overthink). Ive dealt with mild anxiety in the past but nothing like this. During that time it got so bad that I drove thousands of miles to be with relatives. I was able to spend time with them in the evenings which was really helpful and eventually I felt back to normal for the most part. Since then Ive also gotten my job back.

My anxiety is always bad in the mornings; I dont get a lot of sleep because of it which makes it difficult to focus at work. Also, my anxiety gives me get bad stomach aches and I lose my appetite so it makes it really hard to eat. I usually have to force myself to eat every day which just isnt fun. My work is partially opened up and Ive been trying to go in at least a few hours a day just to be around other humans. That helps for sure. Ive been trying to take early morning bike rides as soon as I get up and that typically helps but in the few hours before work starts, Im still rather anxious. Ive tried meditating (which kinda makes things worse), journaling, watching mindless TV, reaching out to friends, etc. I talk to a therapist on a weekly basis which has been helpful. I tried antidepressants (SSRIs) for about 6 months or so and they made my anxiety worse at first and I didnt feel like they were super helpful after that.

I haven't met such a big group since last summer. Only smaller groups and always outdoors. You can probably tell by now that I'm a very careful person when it comes to dealing with the virus. I always followed my principles. Right know I'm going back and fourth whether I should go or not. Is it still okay to apply the precautionary principle here and not attend? I mean I'm 3 weeks out from being fully vaccinated. Everyone else there is in a spirit to party because we couldn't for so long. I'm not having that feeling. Quite the opposite.

I'm struggling so much at the moment with having any sort of hope for the future. It just feels like we will never get normality back. COVID has completely ruined me. I went from being a (mostly) happy and functional human to depressed and suicidal since 2020. I take anti depressants now and I started therapy but even on my good days, I still feel like there's this dark cloud over my head and I'm waiting for the next shitstorm. I live in the UK and we've had three long lockdowns. Everything was looking pretty hopeful a few months ago, but since the last lockdown rules started easing, cases and hospitalisations have started rising again, even though we're doing pretty well with vaccinations. Our Government have handled the pandemic pretty poorly throughout and managed to let the Delta variant in with their loose border control measures. It just feels like this never ending cycle of rising cases, lockdown, falling cases, lift lockdown, rising cases again, etc etc and I'm terrified of going into another lockdown in the Autumn. I can't do it again. We keep saying the lockdowns are to protect our (underfunded) NHS from being overwhelmed but if hospitalisations are already getting too high now in the SUMMER, how the hell will they cope with a Winter wave with not only COVID cases but also a new wave of Flu cases which have been low the last year because of the lockdowns??? I feel guilty for complaining as I know other people have it much worse, and having already had the virus, it's not affected me all that badly. But the restrictions have meant I can no longer do my job (musician), I can't meet a partner, I've lost all hope for the future and I just feel like I'm waiting for the next bit of bad news. If the vaccines aren't enough for getting us out of this shit, what will be???? I just don't feel like life is worth living anymore under these restrictions.

Sometimes I just feel like I'm in a different universe than I was in two years ago and nothing makes sense anymore.

But all I can think about is that this will never end and I will be back in lockdown in October. Evertime I'm happy or having fun or trying to make plans for the future I have a little voice in my head saying 'you can't relax because things are never gonna get better and nothing will work out'.

While the last year and a half have been trying emotionally and professionally for all of us, things are looking up with the vaccine. However, my wife's parents refuse to get vaccinated. They are not in great health and my father-in-law specifically is older and I worry about his health. Therefore, even as things have started to open up, my family has been relatively more conservative, with no masks-free indoor interaction outside of the family, even with people that are vaccinated, for fear of spreading the virus to my inlaws. This is becoming a big problem because I am building a startup and my cofounder is someone I met during the pandemic. He and I need to start building a more regular working cadence and relationship, but this is really difficult since my wife and SIL are not comfortable with me working in person with him, even though he is vaccinated (though he is much less careful than us). For my part, I would like to push the company forward, and agree that our creative work would improve if we were able to work in-person a couple of times per week. I'm just at a loss - my wife is grieving what she perceives as the loss of her parents' sanity and doesn't want to cut them off, but I face real professional challenges (let alone the ongoing personal and mental health challenges) from continuing the status quo. Guiltily, I feel very angry at them - I feel like they are offloading responsibility for their safety on my wife, SIL, and myself, which seems extremely selfish.

Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all.

{"Reddit ID": "ldud2", "Reddit Post": "So, I'm doing some soul searching about my motorcycle.  I've ridden for six years, and have about 100,000 miles under my belt.

When she does homework she has to get up and wash and dry her hands several times. It's very frustrating to her. She's worried she will never get to have a boyfriend, because every time she'll hold hands with him, her palms will be soaking wet. I feel terrible for her, and I have never known anyone personally who has this problem.\n\n\nAnyways, I understand there is a very minor, hardly invasive surgery available for this, wherein the doctor makes a small incision between two of the rids, and basically snips and cauterizes the nerve that triggers this sweating.

People watched as if they pitied me while I struggled to stack the carseat on the suitcase while holding a sqwirmy baby.\n\nI blew off the looks and masterfuly maneuvered baby and luggage to the cart check-out (which don't have baby seats in them) to check one out and make the tow to the parking garage easier.

I set out to find someone to trade two 5s for my ten. No one, not even security would help. \n\nI eventually gave up on the cart and tried to navigate my luggage while wrestling my Christmas ham to sit still and hang on to my neck en route to the garage. Halfway across a street the carseat falls off the suitcase. Again, looks of pity but no offer to help! Eventually I made it to my truck and got home but I wondered the whole way how it was that no one lifted a finger to help me.\n\nI'm not the type of person that looks for handouts but if someone was clearly having a hard time I know I would stop and lend a helping hand.

She's our first, and I was in no way prepared for the number of people who would stop us, want to see her, want to take pictures of her, want to ooohh and ahhh over her all the time.  \n\nI'm sure as she gets a little older, this will decrease.

{"Reddit ID": "pp4ky", "Reddit Post": "So, my day care sent home a readymade bottle for my 5mo old (They were about to feed him, but it was the end of the day, so i just took it with me). We usually give him 6oz in a bottle, and this bottle was full almost to the brim. This is a [Playtex DropIn](http://playtexbaby.com/Bottles/Dropins/Premium-Nurser) bottle, FYI. \n\nSo I call up the day care and ask them what the deal is, this is much more than 6oz of formula. They tell me that they premix the formula, measure it in a separate measuring cup, and then pour 6oz of formula solution in the bottle. This confounds me, so I do a little experiment of my own. I grab my own measuring cup, fill it with 6oz of water, and pour it into the bottle. Lo and behold, it fills to something like 7.5 oz according to the markings on the side of the bottle. \n\nAm I completely missing something here, or is Playtex being very irresponsible about their dropin measurements? Has anyone run into this before? I know an +/- an oz or two isn't really detrimental to my kid as long as he's happy and pooping normally, but I still find this very bizarre.\n\n**Update: I got some Playtex liners, and lo and behold, 6oz of water is now an accurate measurement both in a measuring cup and in a liner.

However, they also seem to be taking precautions to avoid causing harm, such as being careful when pulling a binky or bottle from their infant's mouth. Therefore, the narrator's level of responsibility is moderate.\n\nTo help the narrator reappraise the situation, it may be helpful to remind them that while it is important to be careful when interacting with their infant, they are not solely responsible for their well-being. It is also important to remember that infants are naturally curious and may explore their surroundings, and it is normal for them to have accidents.\n\nIf the narrator is feeling overwhelmed by the responsibility they perceive, it may be helpful to encourage them to take a step back and focus on the positive aspects of being a parent. For example, they could remind themselves of the joy and love they feel when spending time with their infant, and that accidents and setbacks are a natural part of the journey.\n\nIf the narrator is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility, it may be helpful to encourage them to re-evaluate their actions and consider the potential consequences. For example, if they are pulling a binky or bottle out of their infant's mouth too quickly, they could try to slow down and be more gentle. It may also be helpful to seek guidance from a healthcare professional or a parenting expert to learn more about safe and appropriate ways to interact with their infant.\n\nOverall, it is important to remember that being a parent can be challenging, but it is also a rewarding experience.
