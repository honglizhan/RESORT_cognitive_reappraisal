I don't even realize I've done it until it's already over. I get bruises and can't explain them if anyone asks (luckily no one has). Although I do feel it helps to calm me down, I want to stop before I do any real damage. Does anyone have advice/strategies on how to get out of the habit?

It sounds like you're experiencing a common phenomenon known as \"seasonal anger\" or \"tourist rage,\" which is caused by the influx of visitors during the summer months. This can lead to feelings of frustration, anxiety, and overwhelm, especially when you're trying to navigate crowded spaces or deal with traffic.\n\nHere are a few strategies that might help you reappraise the situation and manage your anger:\n\n1. Practice mindfulness: Take a few deep breaths and focus on the present moment. Try to let go of your expectations and judgments about how things should be.\n2. Reframe your thinking: Instead of seeing the crowds as a source of anger, try to view them as a sign of the island's popularity and vitality.\n3. Set boundaries: If you're feeling overwhelmed, take a break and do something that relaxes you, like going for a walk or reading a book.\n4. Find ways to connect: Engage with the visitors and locals around you. Strike up a conversation, ask someone about their day, or share a smile.\n5. Practice self-compassion: Remember that it's okay to feel angry sometimes, and that it's normal to lose your cool in difficult situations.\n\nBy using these strategies, you can learn to reappraise the situation and manage your anger in a healthier way.

I am an adult, I should be past those embarrassing child-like behaviours. Besides, at my age i'm pretty sure this classifies as domestic violence.\nThroughout my life I had those minor outbursts of violence, where i bit people, kicked them etc. then in effort of stopping it, i turned to myself and whenever anger got too overwhelming i would hit myself on the head but that just made me look like i'm unhinged and crazy, so not ideal either. I stopped both of those behaviours 2-3 years ago and I just pinpointed it to teenage hormones/rebellion. i was so sure i got a hold of my violent outbursts, put them past me. i was doing so well, those outbursts were no longer a thing, whenever i was about to throw a rage fit i managed to cool down. but today it came back all over again.\nnow i am seriously afraid I might hurt someone in the future out of anger. or even k*ll them. i'm legit afraid of myself. cause in the moment when i am angry, sometimes i experience such blinding rage that i seemingly can't stop myself.  i am so afraid that in the future i will hurt my potential boyfriend, friends, family. if this never stops, maybe someday i'll go to jail for abuse. i don't want that. i don't wanna be a bad person. i want to get better. \n\ni also feel very sorry and i wanna apologize to my mom. the deal is... she'll forgive me, of course she will, but i don't want to issue an empty apology without showing improvement first. words without improvement are worth nothing.\n\nany good techniques that will help me calm nerves in a heated moment fairly easily? i wanna be a good daughter so bad :(", "Sub-Reddit": "r_anger", "Model": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "reappraisal_output_dim_1": "Based on what you've shared, it sounds like you're struggling with managing your anger and have a fear of losing control and hurting someone.

I've asked her multiple times to let me know if she needs the machine when my clothes are still in there (since we tend to do our laundry at the same time for some reason) because I get irrationally mad when she touches my clothes. It doesn't happen too often since I usually take my clothes out and fold them before she even notices I did laundry, but I forget every once in a while and every time it makes my day a bit worse. I told her today that I don't care if it's 4am and I'm asleep, I want her to at least warn me that she's going to touch my clothes if I don't get up right away. \n\nI went back to my room after taking my clothes and I wanted to scream but I always manage to stop myself by just pretending to yell and by punching my mattress and pillows.

Set boundaries: It sounds like you have asked your mom multiple times to let you know before touching your clothes, so it might be helpful to set a more formal boundary. You could try saying something like, \"I would appreciate it if you could ask me before touching my clothes, as it makes me feel uncomfortable when you don't.\"\n3. Communicate your needs clearly: Instead of getting angry or pretending to yell, try to communicate your needs clearly and calmly. For example, you could say, \"I need you to let me know before touching my clothes, as it makes me feel uncomfortable when you don't.\"\n4. Take a step back: When you start to feel angry or frustrated, try to take a step back and take a few deep breaths. This can help you calm down and gain perspective.\n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful! Remember that it's okay to feel angry sometimes, but it's important to find healthy ways to express and manage your emotions.", "evaluation_raw_output_dim_23": "<score>7</score><rationale>The response does a good job of addressing the narrator's feelings of anger and frustration, and provides specific suggestions on how to manage these emotions.

Here are a few things that might help you reappraise the situation:\n\n1. Recognize that other people's behavior is not about you: When your friend laughed at your haircut or weight, it was about their own insecurities and biases, not about you. And when the people in the grocery store were taking their time, it was likely because they were overwhelmed or uncertain, not because they were trying to annoy you.\n2. Practice empathy: Instead of getting angry at others, try to understand where they're coming from. Put yourself in their shoes and imagine how they might be feeling. This can help you respond in a more compassionate and less reactive way.\n3. Set boundaries: If someone is consistently making you angry or frustrated, it may be time to set some boundaries. This can be as simple as saying \"I don't appreciate it when you do X, can you please stop?\" or \"I need some space right now, can we talk about this later?\"\n4. Take care of yourself: It's important to prioritize your own well-being, especially if you're feeling overwhelmed and angry.

I had anger issues in kindergarten and in elementary school and have been to a psychologist in second grade because my situation was that bad. Nowadays, the issues are much worse, I have lots of stress on me currently with online school and all kinds of things related to it, I am very tired because I am also not getting enough sleep.\n\nWhenever I get angry, I usually just have to smash whatever it is in my hand (controller, pen, notebook etc) against the surface that is closest to me, let it be my desk or bed. This has not only caused me and my family hundreds of dollars of damages, but I also usually get hurt in the process. Sure, wounds can heal, but having them in the first place because of a mental breakdown because my pen has dried out is a pretty fucked up thing in my book. \n\nI tried putting said things down before starting to hit something, but I just have zero self control and can't consistently do so. I also tried calming myself down by just staying still and doing nothing, but that usually gets me even more angry and I cause more harm to myself. I tried hitting other things like my pillows, but that causes almost the same effect as staying still. And after I break something I get sober and realize what I just did and get a bad feeling of doom or whatever that is.\n\nIs there any way I can at the very least minimize these breakouts?

She actually said she liked me 2 years prior (we have 1.5 years of online school), but I ghosted her which was very dumb and entirely my fault.

I haven't really talked to her for 2 years, so I am thinking that I would come off as a creep if I were to talk to her. And she typically walks at a 4mph rate, with arms crossed, looking down, so I don't really know if randomly saying hello would come off as weird or not, or if she doesn't even see me.

I haven't really been able to eat since i started and i barely sleep anymore because i am so anxious and constantly dreading the next shift, and the rest of the week because i only have two days off. This has honestly put me in a very bad place where I just want to find a way to escape it all but I feel as though quitting would make me really disappointed in myself for giving up. But, I dont think i'm able to take care of myself properly while i'm so anxious.

I know this isn't a starbucks issue it's more personal, but i've worked as a barista before in a small local coffee shop and i was completely comfortable after only a few shifts. I don't know what steps to take to help myself right now and I was wondering if the job is really worth all the stress and anxiety. i try many coping techniques like breathing and the 333, and journaling and talking it out or just crying to expel whatever i need to, but it's like a never ending cycle help.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_anxiety", "Model": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "reappraisal_output_dim_1": "Based on what you've shared, it sounds like you're experiencing a lot of stress and anxiety in your new job at Starbucks.

And Xanax never did anything to me besides brutally kill my appetite.\n\nAmbien on the other hand... ignoring the part where we get crazy and do stuff that we will regret later, like texting an old crush and asking him on a date (yeah, I had the date... today, btw! oh well, it was fast)... so, what I was saying is that the good part of Ambien is that you feel some kind of freedom and a really peaceful state of mind.\n\nLSD gave me the closest to what I should feel to be the happiest... but only during the trip. But then there's a problem: you can never know what your next trip will be like. And from paradise I went to pure nightmare (ER and shit).

You have the power to observe them and choose how to respond to them.\n\nYour anxiety and anger are not the root cause of your struggles, but rather a symptom of something deeper. It's possible that you've experienced trauma or stress in the past that has shaped your thoughts and feelings.\n\nYou are not alone. Many people struggle with anxiety and depression, and there are resources available to help you cope. You don't have to face this alone.\n\nYou can learn to manage your anxiety and anger. It won't be easy, but it is possible. You can start by practicing mindfulness, self-compassion, and seeking professional help.\n\nRemember, you are not dying, you are living. You are strong and capable, even if you don't feel like it right now.

We have lived together and always been around each other since we started dating . So why I'm the hell do I still get anxiety when they call us and ask us to dinner or to come over? Sometimes I can do it with no problems. But other times I feel like I'm going to throw up. Even when I know I'm hungry. It sucks so bad.

{"Reddit ID": "Anxiety_79", "Reddit Post": "Hi! New poster so I apologize for any mistakes! \n\nI've been dealing with anxiety and panic attacks since I was in middle school, and I know that they are caused by abandonment issues, as well as some insecurities. I know exactly what my triggers are, why they happen and what specific fear is causing them....so for the most part I have been able to manage it without medication or therapy. Unfortunately, things began to peak two years ago during the beginning of covid and my stress and anxiety ended up actually causing shingles. After this, and getting covid, a few other random symptoms began to occur during major anxiety episodes. These still happen to this day, when it gets bad enough, but doctors have assured me these symptoms are my \"post covid norm now\". A lot happened in that time to cause it, so it wasn't one specific trigger like it used to be. Ever since, I have had a much more difficult time controlling the spiraling that occurs once the thoughts creep in. It is now affecting my personal relationships as well. \n\nMy question is, how are you able to manage the physical and emotional symptoms of anxiety when a major episode does occur?

Practice deep breathing exercises and mindfulness techniques to help calm your body and mind.\n2. Engage in physical activity, such as walking or yoga, to help release tension and improve your mood.\n3. Try to focus on the present moment and take things one step at a time.\n4. Seek out support from friends, family, or a support group to talk through your feelings and emotions.\n\nRemember, healing takes time, and it's okay to take things one step at a time.

{"Reddit ID": "Anxiety_111", "Reddit Post": "Just wanted to share with someone that I filed my tax return all on my own!\n\nFor those outside England a quick simplified brief on our tax system.  If you work for an employer they normally work out how much tax etc you owe and it's deducted at source so what you get in your pay check is yours. But if you're self employed you have to fill in a tax return each year. You can fill in the return from the 6th April and it has to be done by 31st January the following year. So the tax return I've just submitted is for tax year 2020-2021.\n\nI hate doing my tax return. My accounts are really simple, profits easy to calculate and very few expenses. But I'm so paranoid I'll do something wrong. There's so many different fields to fill in and I have no clue what half of them mean. I've always asked my sister to sit with me in the past when I do my returns but this year I did it all on my own.\n\nTo further complicate matters my accounts last year are screwed up because of coronavirus. My income was down ~75% but I was eligible for a government support scheme called the Self Employment Income Support Scheme. However I then had to declare all these figures on my tax returns which was even more boxes to tick.\n\nI also had to claim my fifth grant which means working out my turnover for the last two years etc. and freaking out that I'll somehow claim the wrong amount or screw something up.\n\nIt took me two weeks of staring at the folder to build up the courage and then about half an hour ago I finally hit that sweet spot of the anxiety of not doing it outweighing the anxiety of doing it (the grant deadline is September). So here I am just after midnight waiting for the anxiety adrenaline rush to die down so I can actually get some sleep.\n\nBut I did it! I just needed to share with someone as I'm really proud of myself.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_anxiety", "Model": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "reappraisal_output_dim_1": "Congratulations on completing your tax return!

For awhile now I've been kind of out of it, like my thoughts start racing out of nowhere and I get stressed out. I have ADHD so I've always had trouble focusing. Also my dreams have been weird and vivid, sometimes I'll hear voices in my head before I fall asleep, tbh I don't really know what they say they're just like video game characters and stuff lol. I also used to have really bad sleep paralysis where I saw and heard a lot of weird stuff. But I think hallucinations while your not fully awake are somewhat normal? I was eating smth and I heard \"schizo\" idk why I thought that when I don't even use that word. Maybe because I'm subconsciously worried about having it or smth more serious even though IK I don't. and Ik this sounds stupid but I don't know who to tell.

I dont trust what these health professionals are telling me because they all seem to have different opinions and some have willingly admitted that they dont know enough about autoimmune diseases. Ive been told that Im not at any greater risk of getting covid because of my disease, but have read differently. Im concerned about getting the vaccine because Ive heard from another doctor that its linked to autoimmune responses, but I cant find much online about the matter and Im afraid that if I dont get the vaccine, Ill be putting myself at greater risk.

I've read about different forms \"long Covid\" takes - it's not always persistent - some report reinfection or reactivation of Covid after periods of dormancy. Two weeks after my initial reactivation, my symptoms begin to subside. I decide to get the first Covid vaccine (I read that in some \"vaccine vanguard\" countries like Israel, they were recommending one covid shot for those who had already had the virus). I get the first shot, and feel a little not great for about 48 hours or so (mild discomfort in lymph nodes, some fatigue, weakness), but afterwards I begin to feel great, better than I had at any point since before I got Covid in early May. A week ago I put in a full exercise. About 24 hours later, I don't feel like I felt when I had Covid, but I definitely feel the exact same as I did *after* I had gotten my first shot - mild discomfort in lymph nodes, some weakness. I am under the impression working out a second time \"reactivated\" dormant Covid, but the vaccine kicked back in and enlisted my immune system in fighting this second activation. Finding information about the virus at this time has been so frustrating - official counsel has lagged internet anecdotes and similar by a considerable amount of time.

{"Reddit ID": "o93rqd", "Reddit Post": "Hey, everyone, just in a particularly dark patch, and feeling the need for some dialogue. I've been doing a lot of thinking, lately, and I think I've finally got a handle on why the pandemic has been so chronically stressful for me, and others, over the past year. Specifically those in first world countries, in relation to how it affects us on a psychological level. As people, we tend to experience bad things as happening suddenly, all at once, and then you deal with them. A broken leg, a car wreak, getting fired, getting dumped, etc. Deeply unpleasant, but relatively short-duration things. These are type-1 and type-2 problems; Things which can be avoided, or which can be fixed. But the Coronavirus has loaded us all down with the third type of problem. The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part. Lots of us weren't doing too great before the pandemic hit, but then, after 15 months of slow, grinding lockdowns, endless bad news on top of bad news, and nowhere to go to get away from it... Is it really a wonder why everyone is so unhappy all the time? I feel like a machine that's trying harder and harder to run without lubricant, to the point that it's just scraping metal-on-metal, and every day is a bit harder than the last. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to keep this up. The possibility of a variant wave in the Fall, forcing us back into yet another lockdown, terrifies me. I can't relax, I can't focus, and it's been seven or eight months since I've had any meaningful hope for the future. This late in the game, I just... can't shake the feeling that things will never get better. 2019 was the best things will ever be in my lifetime, and it's all downhill from here.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_covid19_support", "Model": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "reappraisal_output_dim_1": "Here's a concise and brief response to help the narrator reappraise the situation:\n\n\"It's understandable that you feel overwhelmed and hopeless with the pandemic's prolonged duration and the constant barrage of bad news.

I (22f) got my first shot of Biontech last week and so did my sister. My mom is fully vaccinated with Moderna. My stepdad received his first shot of Biontech two days ago. But we also have two kids (age 5 and 3) in our family. Obviously they can't get vaccinated. Hearing that Delta is very transmissible, and often even infects vaccinated folk, scares me. I know efficiency of the vaccines was never 100% but I believed at least we'd be safe from Covid when we get vaccinated. I work full-time and go to school. At school, everyone wears a mask, we are 1,5m apart, the windows are open and everyone gets tested daily. At work, my coworker wears a mask and so do I. When I eat or drink I go outside. Otherwise, I don't take off my mask at all (I wear FFP2 or FFP3). My boss doesn't wear a mask but he only occasionally comes into our office. Also, everyone at my work place had Corona three months ago except me. They caught Alpha (B117). I also have to take public transit. Everyone wears masks. Windows are open. How big is my risk of infection? I have been getting regularly tested since March 21 (1 to 4 times a week) and it came back negative all the time, even when we had a high national incidence and infection was more likely. National incidence is now 5 cases per 100.000 people. In my town it is 3 cases per 100.000 people. At the moment, we have 49 active cases (my town is huge; 500.000 people live here). Do I really have to be worried? I even wear my ffp2 mask when I walk my dog. When I am fully vaccinated, what safety measures should I still follow? I don't mind masks at all, but I'd like to wear makeup someday again lol.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_covid19_support", "Model": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "reappraisal_output_dim_1": "Based on the information provided, it seems that you have taken several precautions to minimize your risk of infection with the Delta variant.

Well, due to my school being concerned about the tools having germs on them, the course was cancelled. Now, as of September 2021, I'm in Grade 11. I amazingly had this course at the exact wrong time.

{"Reddit ID": "od9j5d", "Reddit Post": "Does anyone have any advice on best ways to deal with pretty bad anxiety while living alone and working from home? FWIW, I also live thousands of miles from all of my family. My anxiety got pretty bad several months ago during the holidays when Covid was at its peak and was impossible to see people. I was also still furloughed from work and had a lot of time to think (and overthink). Ive dealt with mild anxiety in the past but nothing like this. During that time it got so bad that I drove thousands of miles to be with relatives. I was able to spend time with them in the evenings which was really helpful and eventually I felt back to normal for the most part. Since then Ive also gotten my job back. However, during the last month Ive gone through a breakup of sorts and that has brought my anxiety back. I lived alone for several years before this and it used to be awesome for me but now it just feels painful. Im almost afraid of being alone. My anxiety is always bad in the mornings; I dont get a lot of sleep because of it which makes it difficult to focus at work. Also, my anxiety gives me get bad stomach aches and I lose my appetite so it makes it really hard to eat. I usually have to force myself to eat every day which just isnt fun. My work is partially opened up and Ive been trying to go in at least a few hours a day just to be around other humans. That helps for sure. Ive been trying to take early morning bike rides as soon as I get up and that typically helps but in the few hours before work starts, Im still rather anxious. Ive tried meditating (which kinda makes things worse), journaling, watching mindless TV, reaching out to friends, etc. I talk to a therapist on a weekly basis which has been helpful. I tried antidepressants (SSRIs) for about 6 months or so and they made my anxiety worse at first and I didnt feel like they were super helpful after that.

I barely leave the house cuz of it now and have to put ointment on my skin because I've been oversanitizing/overwashing to the point where my skin bleeds and cracks. My immediate family isn't against COVID safety by any means, but they definitely make me feel crazy for still wanting to disinfect everything and everything else. The family that's coming hasn't been the safest during COVID. They're now all fully vaccinated, but I'm extremely anxious to be around them and that some freak outbreak could happen between us. I'm trying to set boundaries and minimize exposure, but knowing my family, feeling the weight of their judgment will also give me immense anxiety. Part of me doesn't want to really go to this family event, but my mom keeps reassuring me that it's only our family and no one else (even though that's like 30 people). I also have a rocky relationship with religion due to being queer so being in a church setting to begin with is really hard for me. Does anyone have any advice on how to stop spiraling and calming myself down around everyone?

Cases are very low (sometimes zero) there. Some people there are fully vaccinated, some got their 1st shot and some haven't yet. I got my first shot 3 weeks ago(Moderna). I haven't met such a big group since last summer. Only smaller groups and always outdoors. You can probably tell by now that I'm a very careful person when it comes to dealing with the virus. I always followed my principles. Right know I'm going back and fourth whether I should go or not. Is it still okay to apply the precautionary principle here and not attend? I mean I'm 3 weeks out from being fully vaccinated. Everyone else there is in a spirit to party because we couldn't for so long. I'm not having that feeling. Quite the opposite. Like I have the caveman syndrome when it comes to larger groups. How do you evaluate the situation? I guess I just need some opinions on it.

I struggle with severe food allergies and therefore getting the first dose of the vaccine was incredibly difficult for me. I feared having a severe allergic reaction and had many panic attacks leading up to the vaccine appointment. Luckily, all went well and Im not anticipating my second dose. However, I have a few fears. First, I developed an odd skin reaction approximately one week after vaccination. My forearms became incredibly itchy for about 2-3 days, but I never developed a rash or anything of the sorts. Not sure if it was related to the vaccine, but I cant think of anything else If this was due to the vaccine, does that put me at any risk of having a severe allergic reaction with the second dose?

I live in Italy and here we had three lockdowns, the last one ending around May. They left me absolutely burnt out. Sometimes I just feel like I'm in a different universe than I was in two years ago and nothing makes sense anymore. A lot of nice things are happening to me: I am graduating on Monday, I got my vaccine and maybe my boyfriend will finally be able to come visit after 18 months of not seeing each other. But all I can think about is that this will never end and I will be back in lockdown in October. Evertime I'm happy or having fun or trying to make plans for the future I have a little voice in my head saying 'you can't relax because things are never gonna get better and nothing will work out'. I haven't felt true, unconditional joy since maybe August last year. This past year of isolation broke me completely and I feel like I will never be happy again.

While the last year and a half have been trying emotionally and professionally for all of us, things are looking up with the vaccine. However, my wife's parents refuse to get vaccinated. They are not in great health and my father-in-law specifically is older and I worry about his health. Therefore, even as things have started to open up, my family has been relatively more conservative, with no masks-free indoor interaction outside of the family, even with people that are vaccinated, for fear of spreading the virus to my inlaws. This is becoming a big problem because I am building a startup and my cofounder is someone I met during the pandemic. He and I need to start building a more regular working cadence and relationship, but this is really difficult since my wife and SIL are not comfortable with me working in person with him, even though he is vaccinated (though he is much less careful than us). For my part, I would like to push the company forward, and agree that our creative work would improve if we were able to work in-person a couple of times per week. I'm just at a loss - my wife is grieving what she perceives as the loss of her parents' sanity and doesn't want to cut them off, but I face real professional challenges (let alone the ongoing personal and mental health challenges) from continuing the status quo. Guiltily, I feel very angry at them - I feel like they are offloading responsibility for their safety on my wife, SIL, and myself, which seems extremely selfish.

From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to. I feel like I've become so negative that I don't want to share my thoughts with people because I will bring them down, and I already feel like I pushed some people away by doing this. I emailed multiple psychiatrists, but only one answered me and had one short appointment, and told me I should continue looking because he doesn't have time for new patients. I spend most of my time trying to get the motivation to work but failing, and looking at vaccination percentages and restrictions around the world hoping to see them improve and thinking about where else can be better than here.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_covid19_support", "Model": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "reappraisal_output_dim_1": "Sure, I can help you with that!

I'm a 19 year old autistic Italian boy, but despite being on the spectrum right before the pandemic started I've had a big progress at socializing with people, I hung out with big groups among my friends every Saturday night, we had so much fun, and then the pandemic happened. My group not only shut down for months, but the general spirit of the group kept going downhill, i tried helping them but ended up feeling just as bad as them if not worse. After a painful year of online class (which i could barely even do cus my wifi had given up on me), I thankfully was able to get even both shots of the Moderna vaccine. But even after all that, the group hasn't changed. Whenever someone asks to go out, we get the same answers like \"i can't, i need to study/work\", \"I'll be there next weeks (it's the 4th time they said that) and the spirit is still doom and gloom. I want to find some other friends, but due to how stuck to their circles people are here I'm afraid I'll never be able to find someone else who likes me. What can i do which can help me?

Also, they point out that if a child had a physical disability you would certainly talk about it, e.g.  \"Billy has a XXX so he would be able to go swimming with us, but he loves to sit on deck and you can still play ball with him that way\".\n\nSo what do you think?", "Sub-Reddit": "r_parenting", "Model": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "reappraisal_output_dim_1": "Based on the information provided, it seems that the decision of whether to be upfront with the other kids about your son's Aspergers is a complex one with valid arguments on both sides.

{"Reddit ID": "peobl", "Reddit Post": "One thing I've been thinking about for a while is whether to home-school my daughter when the time comes around. I'd like for her to go to school and make friends, but there are things that schools don't include in their curriculum that I'd like to teach my daughter (communication skills are sometimes not offered for example).\n\nAny parents who home-school: Is it worth it? Does it interfere with your work and life too much? Is it possible to do both 1/2 public and 1/2 home somehow?\n\nEdit: I guess I should clarify- I no way intend to keep my daughter out of social activities, I would most likely have her attend a home-schooling co-op should my decision sway this way. I would also have tutors come over and help her in the areas I have trouble with (math...) so that she doesn't struggle her way through college or group projects. Also, I know how home-schooling can be abused (and why that is one reason it is controversial), my partner and I are both very open minded, free-thinking people who love to explore all realms of ideologies and theories (in other words we aren't going to shove her in Jesus camp and tell her that everyone is evil and wrong except us), also I would have her attend summer camps or maybe join a club so that she would get plenty of social interaction not to mention give us both a brief break from one another (kids need space too!). \n\nI just want her to have a better experience than I did in public schools. I wish I'd learned what I know now back then (I guess we all do) but the classes I was offered were mostly test-prep and my teachers were very, how you say, \"Do what I say, don't ask questions, shut up sit down\" etc...\n\nWe can't afford private school, but there are other school systems I'm looking into, and I have years to decide, I just want to be informed is all. \n\nThanks for everyone's input, I greatly appreciate it!", "Sub-Reddit": "r_parenting", "Model": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "reappraisal_output_dim_1": "Sure, I'd be happy to help!

She has no other issues and is just being kept warm and fed through an iv in the umbilical cord and today started with what we could get from mommy being fed through a tube in her nose. My problem though is, I am terrified, I held her for about 30 mins while she was swaddled up and between the tears of happiness I was terrified. I am so scared of startling her and all the tubes and wires, I would like to do the skin to skin contact, but I am so afraid of damaging her, and all of the wires really really scare me.

People watched as if they pitied me while I struggled to stack the carseat on the suitcase while holding a sqwirmy baby.\n\nI blew off the looks and masterfuly maneuvered baby and luggage to the cart check-out (which don't have baby seats in them) to check one out and make the tow to the parking garage easier. The carts cost 3$ so I dig through my backpack for my wallet, as luck would have it I didn't have enough 1s, but I had a 10 when the machine only accepted 1s and 5s. I set out to find someone to trade two 5s for my ten. No one, not even security would help. \n\nI eventually gave up on the cart and tried to navigate my luggage while wrestling my Christmas ham to sit still and hang on to my neck en route to the garage. Halfway across a street the carseat falls off the suitcase. Again, looks of pity but no offer to help! Eventually I made it to my truck and got home but I wondered the whole way how it was that no one lifted a finger to help me.\n\nI'm not the type of person that looks for handouts but if someone was clearly having a hard time I know I would stop and lend a helping hand.

{"Reddit ID": "ee559", "Reddit Post": "Hello all - my husband and I have been trying to figure out if the amount of attention we get in public with our little girl is normal.  She's 8 months old and as cute as can be.  The thing is - we get a LOT of attention when we go out with her.  Is this normal?  She's our first, and I was in no way prepared for the number of people who would stop us, want to see her, want to take pictures of her, want to ooohh and ahhh over her all the time.  \n\nI'm sure as she gets a little older, this will decrease.  It was flattering at first, but it's beginning to be a bit of a hassle sometimes.  For example, I took her to Chipotle for lunch today.  While I ate (20 minutes) nine different people came up to me to talk about her.  It made it really hard to finish my meal.  At the same time, I noticed that another baby in the restaurant who was around the same age didn't get any of this attention.  \n\nSo, parents of reddit, is this a reasonable amount of attention to expect when taking a baby out in public?  And how to you manage to get done with your activities when people keep stopping you?

{"Reddit ID": "offdq", "Reddit Post": "My two year old is a very advanced speaker. While he got a late start, he speaks in full sentences, uses pronouns, and has no 'r' or 's' or 'l' problems.

For example, if I say something wrong, or he doesn't agree with me, instead of \"no, daddy\", it becomes \"no no no daddy\". It's not just \"no\", either. Sometimes he repeats a word once, sometimes it'll be like 7 times before he can spit out the rest of the sentence.

This past year has been upsetting to her, though.\n\nUp until about a year ago she spent her days with her grandparents. Then they left the country for a while, and she started daycare, which she enjoyed... she had no issues being away from us all day. Her grandparents came back in February, and at the same time, her little brother was born. She went back to staying with the grandparents during the day for the whole spring; then in the summer, grandparents had to leave again. During the summer she started to throw tantrums, especially around eating, but we took it in stride, dealt with it, and things got better. She doesn't do that anymore, though like a lot of kids she just doesn't like to eat much. But she gets enough nutrition.\n\nHer grandparents (who live with us) have been back again since September, and ever since, she panics whenever grandma leaves the room, unless it's just part of her routine. Routine separations are no issue; she's all smiles when mom and I leave for work in the mornings, she goes to bed without fussing. But if someone has to step out unexpectedly, she breaks down.\n\nLast night grandma had to run an errand. In the midst of crying, my daughter sprinted across the room and tripped, of course prompting sympathy from grandma. But something seemed off - there was nothing to trip on where she fell - so in my most gentle and sympathetic voice, after she calmed down, I asked her about it. She volunteered that she fell over on purpose.\n\nEvery time, within minutes of someone leaving, she's fine again, and showing no outward signs of stress.

Here are some strategies to help your child change their behavior:\n\n1. Have a conversation: Explain to your child why their behavior was hurtful and inappropriate. Use age-appropriate language and examples to help them understand.\n2. Set clear expectations: Establish specific rules and consequences for bullying behavior. Make sure your child understands what is expected of them.\n3. Encourage empathy: Help your child develop empathy by discussing how their actions affected others. Ask them to imagine how they would feel if someone treated them the same way.\n4. Model positive behavior: Children learn from what they see, so make sure you are modeling kindness, respect, and appropriate social behavior.\n5.

Maybe he's more afraid of going upstairs alone at night time (not necessarily afraid of the dark), or maybe he's more afraid of just being alone upstairs. I have to sit on the bed with him while he sleeps (putting him to sleep), and then I can safely walk away safely after he has fallen asleep completely. If I walk away 2 minutes into putting him to sleep, while he hasn't fallen asleep yet, he'll tell me 'please stay', almost begging me to stay. If I tell him to go up and sleep by himself, he refuses. If he stays up late downstairs, then he might just fall asleep on the sofa. This is becoming a headache and it wastes about 20-30 mins of my time every night while putting him to sleep.\n\nIt's been like this for years, I just figured one day he'll say 'ok I'm ready to do this on my own'.

I figured it would never happen because they're very expensive and with two young kids on a single income, there was no way.  \n\nThen, a local boudoir photographer ran a contest where the winner gets a full set of photos and prints.  She's promised to do a full boudoir shoot for me if she wins this contest, and I could really use your support.\n\nThe winner is decided by Facebook \"Likes\", and I'd really appreciate the support of some fellow new parents.  I think it took a lot of guts to do this 6 months after having a baby, and it would mean a lot to her to win (she says she doesn't feel \"sexy\" anymore). \n\nedit: Thanks very much for all your support and nice comments!\n\nIf you wouldn't mind, could you help me show her she IS still sexy by \"Liking\" [this photo?](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=361522470538796&amp;set=a.361522117205498.90549.112331498791229&amp;type=1&amp;theater)\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention the pics are not nude, she's wearing panties and a shirt.
