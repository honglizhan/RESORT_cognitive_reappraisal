My one condition was that she be potty trained. She is potty trained, however, she is scared of literally EVERYTHING and also doesn't like me, so when he is gone she gets anxious and any loud noise or sudden movement has her peeing, trembling, whining, teeth chattering, the whole nine yards. She has even peed on my pillow in my bed before. It sends me through the roof, so much so that I need to leave so that I do not become violent. The thing that sucks is that other than her noise phobia, peeing, and separation anxiety from my bf, she is a very sweet and well trained dog.

I'm still really pissed right now typing this and have no idea how to feel better.\n\nMy apartment manager let us know that packages can no longer be delivered to the office- just our front doors. When I read the message I immediately knew that they would not leave packages at our door because they literally never did and the entire team just seems fucking lazy. So lo and behold, i check my mailbox and see a \"sorry we missed you\" notice. I was home ALL DAY and the package was an amazon package which does not require a signature and they refused to deliver it to my door.\n\nI had to go to the post office to pick it up. When I get there I tell the lady and ask why I'm here essentially why can't they just deliver to my fucking door. She says that it'd take the workers too long to do that because our complex gets so many packages. I'm soo annoyed. I feel inconvenienced because of the drive there and how absolutely unnecessary this is. It's like the residents are being punished because we order packages. Ridiculous. This always happens when I'm inconvenienced and know that others are in the wrong. I get even more pissed because I try to do the right thing when it comes to others and feel the lack of communication between my apartment managers and the USPS shows complete disregard for the residents. When I'm like this I stay mad for way too long. I don't react violently but I definitely take out my anger on those around me.

I get extremely angry and violent when my mom does things that I've asked her not to do, sometimes it involves other people but mostly my mom since I'm around her the most.

I've asked her multiple times to let me know if she needs the machine when my clothes are still in there (since we tend to do our laundry at the same time for some reason) because I get irrationally mad when she touches my clothes. It doesn't happen too often since I usually take my clothes out and fold them before she even notices I did laundry, but I forget every once in a while and every time it makes my day a bit worse. I told her today that I don't care if it's 4am and I'm asleep, I want her to at least warn me that she's going to touch my clothes if I don't get up right away. \n\nI went back to my room after taking my clothes and I wanted to scream but I always manage to stop myself by just pretending to yell and by punching my mattress and pillows.

I am justified in my anger, but I feel so immensely guilty for being angry. I tried ignoring my parents and brother and I even ignored one text from my mom. I cried and cried, not because I was angry, but because I felt so guilty and it was tearing me apart. I went to work upset, and tried to play off my watery eyes on my allergies. It really messed me up and as soon as I clocked out and got in my car to head home, I started crying again. It's like I want to be angry and I know I have reason to be, but I keep thinking about how \"what if something happens to them and the last thing they knew was that you didn't want to speak to them.\" I just keep thinking how I don't want to lose my mom or my brother. I want to be on good terms with them because I don't want something bad to happen. This is really affecting my ability to dispel my anger and deal with it in a normal way. I have always noticed that I feel guilt when I get angry at my family, but this time it has been full force. I've even been getting migraines because of how stressed out I have been over this. My family is great and they aren't narcissistic or anything like that. I just really don't understand why I feel the way that I feel.

I had anger issues in kindergarten and in elementary school and have been to a psychologist in second grade because my situation was that bad. Nowadays, the issues are much worse, I have lots of stress on me currently with online school and all kinds of things related to it, I am very tired because I am also not getting enough sleep.\n\nWhenever I get angry, I usually just have to smash whatever it is in my hand (controller, pen, notebook etc) against the surface that is closest to me, let it be my desk or bed. This has not only caused me and my family hundreds of dollars of damages, but I also usually get hurt in the process. Sure, wounds can heal, but having them in the first place because of a mental breakdown because my pen has dried out is a pretty fucked up thing in my book. \n\nI tried putting said things down before starting to hit something, but I just have zero self control and can't consistently do so. I also tried calming myself down by just staying still and doing nothing, but that usually gets me even more angry and I cause more harm to myself. I tried hitting other things like my pillows, but that causes almost the same effect as staying still. And after I break something I get sober and realize what I just did and get a bad feeling of doom or whatever that is.\n\nIs there any way I can at the very least minimize these breakouts? It's starting to get very expensive and I have a feeling if this worsens, many other things are on the way that could completely ruin me, as if I am not that bad already.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_anger", "Model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", "reappraisal_output_dim_1": "It's understandable to feel overwhelmed and frustrated when dealing with anger issues.

Though I get it wasn't really the right thing to feel, anger used to feel... satisfying in a way. Like I'd feel better afterward.   \n\n\nBut recently that's changed. I get so disproportionally angry at most things that are even just mildly frustrating, and it's always so much.. I want to explode every day, but it doesn't feel the same.

It's like I'm taken over by a depressive haze that makes me want to cry almost, before even that fades leaving me feel numb, in a really really bad way.

I went on a trip to Mexico to visit relatives. Some of my aunts and uncles from the US also came. I speak and understand Spanish really well, but combined with my anxiety and the language barrier, I won't talk very much\n\nOne time, we went to someone's house for New Years Eve. We had been there for five hours already, and I got kind of bored of listening to people talk. It's not that they're boring, but for me, listening to people talk in a language that's not my native language is difficult after several hours. I guess I was turning my head a lot, trying to find an interesting conversation, when my aunt asked me \"does it embarrass you to look at people?\" With a smile on her face\n\nA couple of days later, we went to a party with mariachi. When we got there, my aunt said \"smile, look confident. Didn't your mother ever teach you that?\" With a smile on her face. An hour later, some people we knew arrived. After greeting them, we walked back to our table. I was ahead of my aunt, and I looked down for a split second. She said \"(my name), don't look down\". \n\nAnother time, we went to someone's house for dinner. The hostess asked me if I liked the town. I said yes. I wanted to elaborate, but I had food in my mouth. The subject had already changed when my aunt started looking at me in my peripheral vision.

Hi I have social anxiety and I was wondering, there's this girl that occasionally walks past me in the hallway and we were classmates for one year in a class and I have tried to initiate contact with her. She actually said she liked me 2 years prior (we have 1.5 years of online school), but I ghosted her which was very dumb and entirely my fault. I have miserably failed because of my social anxiety around her. My heart races and my mind goes blank with hesitation every time I'm around her. I haven't really talked to her for 2 years, so I am thinking that I would come off as a creep if I were to talk to her. And she typically walks at a 4mph rate, with arms crossed, looking down, so I don't really know if randomly saying hello would come off as weird or not, or if she doesn't even see me.

Unless they are in the movies and are like R2D2 or C3PO,  I have a real existential dread of robots and AI.  Being told to get the hell over it and adapt just makes me get angry that I wasn't born in the 50s or 60s.  I honestly hate technology and I feel inferior over it, I feel like it just makes everyone lazier and less likely to think; and I don't want to see robots taking jobs.   I know automation and machines have always replaced workers, but there was always new stuff to do.  I have this great fear of the world just turning out like Wall-e, where everyone just sits around, while robots do all the work.  This is an actual fear of mine, and my brain is constantly trying to find ways to show that yes, people are getting lazier, yes people are getting dumber.  Or you actually like going to school in person, using paper money, shopping in physical stores, hobbies where you work with your hands?  No one wants that anymore, in the future everything will be all computers and technology.   I just feel like tech is just so damn impersonal, and I feel like I am the only one feeling this way that is my age.  Sometimes I honestly wonder if I am a bad person or a narcissist for thinking that we shouldn't want to be too reliant on technology, and it is good to want to contribute to society and use our brains and muscles.

I've done Klonopin and Xanan in the past and because it was incredibly addictive and I knew that the long-term damage in the brain would be irreversible I decided to quit.\\*\\*\n\nKlonopin gives me a mellow and sweet feeling, but in the next day I feel super depressed. And Xanax never did anything to me besides brutally kill my appetite.\n\nAmbien on the other hand... ignoring the part where we get crazy and do stuff that we will regret later, like texting an old crush and asking him on a date (yeah, I had the date... today, btw! oh well, it was fast)... so, what I was saying is that the good part of Ambien is that you feel some kind of freedom and a really peaceful state of mind.\n\nLSD gave me the closest to what I should feel to be the happiest... but only during the trip. But then there's a problem: you can never know what your next trip will be like. And from paradise I went to pure nightmare (ER and shit). So I don't feel like trying it again even microdosing - same goes for shrooms. And weed... yeah, it's pleasurable and shit, but I don't know how it would be if I use it in long term.\n\nI'm thinking more of a controlled substance for now, aimed for anxiety and is similar to what Ambien does. What do we have? I want to have my mind exactly like it is right now while I'm on Ambien: I feel that I can focus, study and the same time being super original e capable of relax whenever I can.

This has gotten so bad I'm unable to work, socialize with friends and family, or do something as simple as take my dog for a walk. I am barely holding on and I can't handle much more of this. I was prescribed Cipralex a few months ago and I only took that for a few days because medication is one of the many things that give me anxiety, and than I search every little thing and scare myself into even feeling sick. Today I was prescribed sertraline, and I even went to pick it up and it's in my medicine cabinet now.

I have been to counseling, which helped slightly, I am on anxiety medicine too since counseling did not help enough. Even with anxiety medicine, I still struggle with anxiety and because of it, depression.

I would say it slightly helps but I also wonder sometimes if it is just a placebo affect in my mind.\n\n I struggle to work, be social or anything \"normal\" people do. The longest I have had a job was 7 months straight before I quit and changed jobs. I am a hard worker when my anxiety doesn't get the best of me and I have excelled in any job I have done. I've even excelled in school and just got my Associates degree. Now I am incredibly anxious because I need to get a job again now that I completed school but all I can think of is how anxious it makes me. I don't like to make mistakes or get in trouble, and I do everything in my power to do things right, however I know it is IMPOSSIBLE to be perfect.

New poster so I apologize for any mistakes! \n\nI've been dealing with anxiety and panic attacks since I was in middle school, and I know that they are caused by abandonment issues, as well as some insecurities. I know exactly what my triggers are, why they happen and what specific fear is causing them....so for the most part I have been able to manage it without medication or therapy. Unfortunately, things began to peak two years ago during the beginning of covid and my stress and anxiety ended up actually causing shingles. After this, and getting covid, a few other random symptoms began to occur during major anxiety episodes. These still happen to this day, when it gets bad enough, but doctors have assured me these symptoms are my \"post covid norm now\". A lot happened in that time to cause it, so it wasn't one specific trigger like it used to be. Ever since, I have had a much more difficult time controlling the spiraling that occurs once the thoughts creep in. It is now affecting my personal relationships as well. \n\nMy question is, how are you able to manage the physical and emotional symptoms of anxiety when a major episode does occur?

{"Reddit ID": "Anxiety_111", "Reddit Post": "Just wanted to share with someone that I filed my tax return all on my own!\n\nFor those outside England a quick simplified brief on our tax system.  If you work for an employer they normally work out how much tax etc you owe and it's deducted at source so what you get in your pay check is yours. But if you're self employed you have to fill in a tax return each year. You can fill in the return from the 6th April and it has to be done by 31st January the following year. So the tax return I've just submitted is for tax year 2020-2021.\n\nI hate doing my tax return. My accounts are really simple, profits easy to calculate and very few expenses. But I'm so paranoid I'll do something wrong. There's so many different fields to fill in and I have no clue what half of them mean. I've always asked my sister to sit with me in the past when I do my returns but this year I did it all on my own.\n\nTo further complicate matters my accounts last year are screwed up because of coronavirus. My income was down ~75% but I was eligible for a government support scheme called the Self Employment Income Support Scheme. However I then had to declare all these figures on my tax returns which was even more boxes to tick.\n\nI also had to claim my fifth grant which means working out my turnover for the last two years etc. and freaking out that I'll somehow claim the wrong amount or screw something up.\n\nIt took me two weeks of staring at the folder to build up the courage and then about half an hour ago I finally hit that sweet spot of the anxiety of not doing it outweighing the anxiety of doing it (the grant deadline is September). So here I am just after midnight waiting for the anxiety adrenaline rush to die down so I can actually get some sleep.\n\nBut I did it!

{"Reddit ID": "o93rqd", "Reddit Post": "Hey, everyone, just in a particularly dark patch, and feeling the need for some dialogue. I've been doing a lot of thinking, lately, and I think I've finally got a handle on why the pandemic has been so chronically stressful for me, and others, over the past year. Specifically those in first world countries, in relation to how it affects us on a psychological level. As people, we tend to experience bad things as happening suddenly, all at once, and then you deal with them. A broken leg, a car wreak, getting fired, getting dumped, etc. Deeply unpleasant, but relatively short-duration things. These are type-1 and type-2 problems; Things which can be avoided, or which can be fixed. But the Coronavirus has loaded us all down with the third type of problem. The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part. Lots of us weren't doing too great before the pandemic hit, but then, after 15 months of slow, grinding lockdowns, endless bad news on top of bad news, and nowhere to go to get away from it... Is it really a wonder why everyone is so unhappy all the time? I feel like a machine that's trying harder and harder to run without lubricant, to the point that it's just scraping metal-on-metal, and every day is a bit harder than the last. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to keep this up. The possibility of a variant wave in the Fall, forcing us back into yet another lockdown, terrifies me. I can't relax, I can't focus, and it's been seven or eight months since I've had any meaningful hope for the future. This late in the game, I just... can't shake the feeling that things will never get better. 2019 was the best things will ever be in my lifetime, and it's all downhill from here.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_covid19_support", "Model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", "reappraisal_output_dim_1": "It's understandable to feel overwhelmed and hopeless during these challenging times.

{"Reddit ID": "obufss", "Reddit Post": "Hi Folks, Hope y'all have been doing well. I'm from Germany, and I'm well, pretty worried about Delta Variant. I (22f) got my first shot of Biontech last week and so did my sister. My mom is fully vaccinated with Moderna. My stepdad received his first shot of Biontech two days ago. But we also have two kids (age 5 and 3) in our family. Obviously they can't get vaccinated. Hearing that Delta is very transmissible, and often even infects vaccinated folk, scares me. I know efficiency of the vaccines was never 100% but I believed at least we'd be safe from Covid when we get vaccinated. I work full-time and go to school. At school, everyone wears a mask, we are 1,5m apart, the windows are open and everyone gets tested daily. At work, my coworker wears a mask and so do I. When I eat or drink I go outside. Otherwise, I don't take off my mask at all (I wear FFP2 or FFP3). My boss doesn't wear a mask but he only occasionally comes into our office. Also, everyone at my work place had Corona three months ago except me. They caught Alpha (B117). I also have to take public transit. Everyone wears masks. Windows are open. How big is my risk of infection? I have been getting regularly tested since March 21 (1 to 4 times a week) and it came back negative all the time, even when we had a high national incidence and infection was more likely. National incidence is now 5 cases per 100.000 people. In my town it is 3 cases per 100.000 people. At the moment, we have 49 active cases (my town is huge; 500.000 people live here). Do I really have to be worried? I even wear my ffp2 mask when I walk my dog. When I am fully vaccinated, what safety measures should I still follow? I don't mind masks at all, but I'd like to wear makeup someday again lol.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_covid19_support", "Model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", "reappraisal_output_dim_1": "The narrator's concerns about the Delta variant are understandable, but it's important to remember that vaccines still provide significant protection against severe illness and hospitalization.

{"Reddit ID": "od9j5d", "Reddit Post": "Does anyone have any advice on best ways to deal with pretty bad anxiety while living alone and working from home? FWIW, I also live thousands of miles from all of my family. My anxiety got pretty bad several months ago during the holidays when Covid was at its peak and was impossible to see people. I was also still furloughed from work and had a lot of time to think (and overthink). Ive dealt with mild anxiety in the past but nothing like this. During that time it got so bad that I drove thousands of miles to be with relatives. I was able to spend time with them in the evenings which was really helpful and eventually I felt back to normal for the most part. Since then Ive also gotten my job back. However, during the last month Ive gone through a breakup of sorts and that has brought my anxiety back. I lived alone for several years before this and it used to be awesome for me but now it just feels painful. Im almost afraid of being alone. My anxiety is always bad in the mornings; I dont get a lot of sleep because of it which makes it difficult to focus at work. Also, my anxiety gives me get bad stomach aches and I lose my appetite so it makes it really hard to eat. I usually have to force myself to eat every day which just isnt fun. My work is partially opened up and Ive been trying to go in at least a few hours a day just to be around other humans. That helps for sure. Ive been trying to take early morning bike rides as soon as I get up and that typically helps but in the few hours before work starts, Im still rather anxious. Ive tried meditating (which kinda makes things worse), journaling, watching mindless TV, reaching out to friends, etc. I talk to a therapist on a weekly basis which has been helpful. I tried antidepressants (SSRIs) for about 6 months or so and they made my anxiety worse at first and I didnt feel like they were super helpful after that.

Before I got vaccinated, I was in constant in fear of dying, spreading it to someone high risk, or my family getting sick/dying. My immediate family knows that I suffer with it, but no one aside from my brother really understands the levity of how crippling it can be. I barely leave the house cuz of it now and have to put ointment on my skin because I've been oversanitizing/overwashing to the point where my skin bleeds and cracks. My immediate family isn't against COVID safety by any means, but they definitely make me feel crazy for still wanting to disinfect everything and everything else. The family that's coming hasn't been the safest during COVID. They're now all fully vaccinated, but I'm extremely anxious to be around them and that some freak outbreak could happen between us. I'm trying to set boundaries and minimize exposure, but knowing my family, feeling the weight of their judgment will also give me immense anxiety. Part of me doesn't want to really go to this family event, but my mom keeps reassuring me that it's only our family and no one else (even though that's like 30 people). I also have a rocky relationship with religion due to being queer so being in a church setting to begin with is really hard for me.

While the last year and a half have been trying emotionally and professionally for all of us, things are looking up with the vaccine. However, my wife's parents refuse to get vaccinated. They are not in great health and my father-in-law specifically is older and I worry about his health. Therefore, even as things have started to open up, my family has been relatively more conservative, with no masks-free indoor interaction outside of the family, even with people that are vaccinated, for fear of spreading the virus to my inlaws. This is becoming a big problem because I am building a startup and my cofounder is someone I met during the pandemic. He and I need to start building a more regular working cadence and relationship, but this is really difficult since my wife and SIL are not comfortable with me working in person with him, even though he is vaccinated (though he is much less careful than us). For my part, I would like to push the company forward, and agree that our creative work would improve if we were able to work in-person a couple of times per week. I'm just at a loss - my wife is grieving what she perceives as the loss of her parents' sanity and doesn't want to cut them off, but I face real professional challenges (let alone the ongoing personal and mental health challenges) from continuing the status quo.

From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to. I feel like I've become so negative that I don't want to share my thoughts with people because I will bring them down, and I already feel like I pushed some people away by doing this. I emailed multiple psychiatrists, but only one answered me and had one short appointment, and told me I should continue looking because he doesn't have time for new patients.

In fact she pressures the exact opposite since she doesn't want to hear me gripe about not having a bike.\n\nMy son is thirteen months old.  Every time I leave on the bike I make sure the last thing I say to him, and my wife is that I love them.  A small part of this is too ensure that if I'm on the bike and my number comes up, the last thing I've said to them is the most important thing that needs to be said.\n\nI don't think I can do this anymore.  Today, while riding, I just couldn't stop thinking about how absurd my little ritual is since I'm actually out there doing something that increases the likely hood that my innocent \"I love you\" really will the last thing they hear me say.\n\nSo, I'm curious how other bikers dealt with this.  Did you give it up? Do you regret it?  I can't help but feel like the pang of regret I might feel on a sunny day with no bike would probably be outweighed with a satisfied feeling of duty to my family.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_parenting", "Model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", "reappraisal_output_dim_1": "It's understandable to feel conflicted about continuing to ride a motorcycle with a young family.

She came at 31 weeks and 4 days. She is so tiny, 3 lbs 13 ounces and 16 3/4 inches. She came out crying and has not needed any help breathing, she seems to be doing wonderfully. She has no other issues and is just being kept warm and fed through an iv in the umbilical cord and today started with what we could get from mommy being fed through a tube in her nose. My problem though is, I am terrified, I held her for about 30 mins while she was swaddled up and between the tears of happiness I was terrified. I am so scared of startling her and all the tubes and wires, I would like to do the skin to skin contact, but I am so afraid of damaging her, and all of the wires really really scare me. What can I do? Should I be as afraid as I am? I just have no idea what to do, we also have a 6 year old daughter and I have kind of taken over on taking care of her, but I want to make sure I get to bond with my new lady as well.

{"Reddit ID": "q6c2j", "Reddit Post": "I was flying from Phoenix to Raliegh alone with my 1 year old this afternoon, the flight wasn't a problem since my son shares my love of travel, but when we got to baggage claim I got flustered.\n\nAt the carousel I had to pick up a large suitcase and his carseat, which was no easy task while carrying an excited little boy who wants to get down and walk. People watched as if they pitied me while I struggled to stack the carseat on the suitcase while holding a sqwirmy baby.\n\nI blew off the looks and masterfuly maneuvered baby and luggage to the cart check-out (which don't have baby seats in them) to check one out and make the tow to the parking garage easier. The carts cost 3$ so I dig through my backpack for my wallet, as luck would have it I didn't have enough 1s, but I had a 10 when the machine only accepted 1s and 5s. I set out to find someone to trade two 5s for my ten. No one, not even security would help. \n\nI eventually gave up on the cart and tried to navigate my luggage while wrestling my Christmas ham to sit still and hang on to my neck en route to the garage. Halfway across a street the carseat falls off the suitcase. Again, looks of pity but no offer to help!

He started off by not wanting to come to my house for my parenting time. So, like an freakin' idiot trying to be a cool dad I let it slide. 10 weeks later he stomping his foot and still saying that I can't make him come over. I'm supposed to have him every weekend and haven't seen him for 2 1/2 months. During that time we were trying to do counseling (he and I) to get it worked out. After 3 sessions he stomped his foot again and refused to go.\n\nSoooo, I finally laid down the law - literally. Told him I was picking him up this Friday and that was that. He stomped his foot and said \"you can't make me\", but it turns out that \"YEAH I CAN\". So i told him that and also how I was going to do it. It involves the police and a neat little thing called a Civil Standby (Civil Assist).\n\nHence the \" I hate you!!!\"\n\nIt's a bit more complicated than that, but does that help clear it up?\n\n\n\n**Second Edit:\n\nThe worst part is that he really is a great kid.

{"Reddit ID": "pp4ky", "Reddit Post": "So, my day care sent home a readymade bottle for my 5mo old (They were about to feed him, but it was the end of the day, so i just took it with me). We usually give him 6oz in a bottle, and this bottle was full almost to the brim. This is a [Playtex DropIn](http://playtexbaby.com/Bottles/Dropins/Premium-Nurser) bottle, FYI. \n\nSo I call up the day care and ask them what the deal is, this is much more than 6oz of formula. They tell me that they premix the formula, measure it in a separate measuring cup, and then pour 6oz of formula solution in the bottle. This confounds me, so I do a little experiment of my own. I grab my own measuring cup, fill it with 6oz of water, and pour it into the bottle. Lo and behold, it fills to something like 7.5 oz according to the markings on the side of the bottle. \n\nAm I completely missing something here, or is Playtex being very irresponsible about their dropin measurements? Has anyone run into this before? I know an +/- an oz or two isn't really detrimental to my kid as long as he's happy and pooping normally, but I still find this very bizarre.\n\n**Update: I got some Playtex liners, and lo and behold, 6oz of water is now an accurate measurement both in a measuring cup and in a liner.

Buy bicycles?  We currently live outside of Denver, \"entertainment\" - we live in a house, with a dog and a yard.  In China, we will live in a hotel.\n\nMeltdowns - my almost-6-year old had a major meltdown last night. \nI realized that she was hungry and tired, but as a single parent, I'm worried that the stress of being in a foreign country will put my right over the edge.
