My boyfriend absolutely loves dogs and got a Beagle about 6 mos. ago. I on the other hand could do without ever seeing a dog again, but I put up with them. My one condition was that she be potty trained. She is potty trained, however, she is scared of literally EVERYTHING and also doesn't like me, so when he is gone she gets anxious and any loud noise or sudden movement has her peeing, trembling, whining, teeth chattering, the whole nine yards. She has even peed on my pillow in my bed before. It sends me through the roof, so much so that I need to leave so that I do not become violent. The thing that sucks is that other than her noise phobia, peeing, and separation anxiety from my bf, she is a very sweet and well trained dog. Her and I just do not get along, especially when she pees out of fear. \nBUT I hold onto the anger of wanting to just beat the hell out of her for days.

I never even get any interest to even get a response that's not a rejection. I don't know what it is.

However, it's important to remember that there are many factors that can affect your success in the dating scene, and it's not always solely about your appearance.\n\nFirstly, it's important to focus on improving your online presence. Make sure your profile is complete and accurately reflects who you are. Use high-quality photos and write a clear and concise bio that highlights your interests and personality. Additionally, consider reaching out to a professional to help you with your online dating profile.\n\nSecondly, it's important to be open-minded and willing to try new things. Don't limit yourself to just one or two dating apps. Instead, try out a variety of platforms to see which one works best for you. Additionally, consider joining a dating group or attending social events to meet new people in person.\n\nLastly, it's important to remember that dating is a process and it takes time. Don't get discouraged if you don't see immediate results. Instead, focus on self-improvement and personal growth. This will not only make you a more attractive partner, but it will also help you become a better version of yourself.\n\nRemember, it's not about blaming anyone or anything, it's about taking responsibility for your own actions and making changes to improve your situation.", "evaluation_raw_output_dim_1": "Yes", "reappraisal_output_dim_4": "It sounds like you're feeling frustrated and overwhelmed with the dating scene. It's important to remember that the issue may not be entirely in your control, but there are steps you can take to improve your chances of finding a date.\n\nFirst, it might be helpful to reevaluate your approach to dating. Are you putting yourself out there and actively trying to meet new people? Are you being authentic and true to yourself in your interactions with others? It's important to be confident and comfortable in your own skin, and to focus on being the best version of yourself rather than trying to fit into a certain mold.\n\nIt's also important to remember that dating is a numbers game. The more you put yourself out there and try, the more likely you are to find someone who is a good match for you. Don't get discouraged if you don't get a response right away - keep trying and don't give up.\n\nIf you're feeling overwhelmed, it might be helpful to break down the problem into smaller, more manageable steps. For example, you could start by focusing on improving your online presence by updating your profile on dating apps and making sure your photos are up-to-date and representative of who you are. You could also try joining a local club or group that aligns with your interests, where you can meet new people in person.\n\nRemember, finding a date takes time and effort, but with persistence and a positive attitude, you can increase your chances of success.

Nowadays, the issues are much worse, I have lots of stress on me currently with online school and all kinds of things related to it, I am very tired because I am also not getting enough sleep.\n\nWhenever I get angry, I usually just have to smash whatever it is in my hand (controller, pen, notebook etc) against the surface that is closest to me, let it be my desk or bed. This has not only caused me and my family hundreds of dollars of damages, but I also usually get hurt in the process. Sure, wounds can heal, but having them in the first place because of a mental breakdown because my pen has dried out is a pretty fucked up thing in my book. \n\nI tried putting said things down before starting to hit something, but I just have zero self control and can't consistently do so. I also tried calming myself down by just staying still and doing nothing, but that usually gets me even more angry and I cause more harm to myself.

I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh. \n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, \"oh hes not that,\" and move on.

She actually said she liked me 2 years prior (we have 1.5 years of online school), but I ghosted her which was very dumb and entirely my fault.

This is my first time posting on here. I will be 19 in two days, I have been struggling with anxiety, and depression for about three years now, at least that's when it got really bad. I panic through out all day almost every day about every little thing and I am in bed all day every day, too scared to stay standing up for longer than going to get food or to the bathroom before I run back to my bed. This has gotten so bad I'm unable to work, socialize with friends and family, or do something as simple as take my dog for a walk. I am barely holding on and I can't handle much more of this. I was prescribed Cipralex a few months ago and I only took that for a few days because medication is one of the many things that give me anxiety, and than I search every little thing and scare myself into even feeling sick. Today I was prescribed sertraline, and I even went to pick it up and it's in my medicine cabinet now. I read up on this medication for so long and I'm so scared to start it not knowing what to expect, so I guess I'm just looking for advice and to hear other peoples stories and hopefully gain some motivation and courage to start this medication that could potentially change my life.

New poster so I apologize for any mistakes! \n\nI've been dealing with anxiety and panic attacks since I was in middle school, and I know that they are caused by abandonment issues, as well as some insecurities. I know exactly what my triggers are, why they happen and what specific fear is causing them....so for the most part I have been able to manage it without medication or therapy. Unfortunately, things began to peak two years ago during the beginning of covid and my stress and anxiety ended up actually causing shingles. After this, and getting covid, a few other random symptoms began to occur during major anxiety episodes. These still happen to this day, when it gets bad enough, but doctors have assured me these symptoms are my \"post covid norm now\". A lot happened in that time to cause it, so it wasn't one specific trigger like it used to be.

If you work for an employer they normally work out how much tax etc you owe and it's deducted at source so what you get in your pay check is yours. But if you're self employed you have to fill in a tax return each year. You can fill in the return from the 6th April and it has to be done by 31st January the following year. So the tax return I've just submitted is for tax year 2020-2021.\n\nI hate doing my tax return. My accounts are really simple, profits easy to calculate and very few expenses. But I'm so paranoid I'll do something wrong. There's so many different fields to fill in and I have no clue what half of them mean. I've always asked my sister to sit with me in the past when I do my returns but this year I did it all on my own.\n\nTo further complicate matters my accounts last year are screwed up because of coronavirus. My income was down ~75% but I was eligible for a government support scheme called the Self Employment Income Support Scheme. However I then had to declare all these figures on my tax returns which was even more boxes to tick.\n\nI also had to claim my fifth grant which means working out my turnover for the last two years etc. and freaking out that I'll somehow claim the wrong amount or screw something up.\n\nIt took me two weeks of staring at the folder to build up the courage and then about half an hour ago I finally hit that sweet spot of the anxiety of not doing it outweighing the anxiety of doing it (the grant deadline is September). So here I am just after midnight waiting for the anxiety adrenaline rush to die down so I can actually get some sleep.\n\nBut I did it!

I'd like to explain why these fears simply are not rational. Despite what some say, Israel has not achieved herd immunity. They are very close, of course, but they are not at that milestone *yet.* About 5,160,000 Israelis are fully vaccinated, equivalent to roughly 56% of the Israeli population is fully vaccinated. Add that to all the Israelis who have attained natural immunity from the virus, and the percentage rate of immunity within Israel arrives at roughly 66%. For a group to have herd immunity to COVID-19, 70% must be immune. Because Israel has yet to achieve herd immunity, it is still possible for an outbreak to take place.

Two weeks after my initial reactivation, my symptoms begin to subside. I decide to get the first Covid vaccine (I read that in some \"vaccine vanguard\" countries like Israel, they were recommending one covid shot for those who had already had the virus). I get the first shot, and feel a little not great for about 48 hours or so (mild discomfort in lymph nodes, some fatigue, weakness), but afterwards I begin to feel great, better than I had at any point since before I got Covid in early May. A week ago I put in a full exercise.

I've been doing a lot of thinking, lately, and I think I've finally got a handle on why the pandemic has been so chronically stressful for me, and others, over the past year. Specifically those in first world countries, in relation to how it affects us on a psychological level. As people, we tend to experience bad things as happening suddenly, all at once, and then you deal with them. A broken leg, a car wreak, getting fired, getting dumped, etc. Deeply unpleasant, but relatively short-duration things. These are type-1 and type-2 problems; Things which can be avoided, or which can be fixed. But the Coronavirus has loaded us all down with the third type of problem. The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part. Lots of us weren't doing too great before the pandemic hit, but then, after 15 months of slow, grinding lockdowns, endless bad news on top of bad news, and nowhere to go to get away from it... Is it really a wonder why everyone is so unhappy all the time? I feel like a machine that's trying harder and harder to run without lubricant, to the point that it's just scraping metal-on-metal, and every day is a bit harder than the last. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to keep this up. The possibility of a variant wave in the Fall, forcing us back into yet another lockdown, terrifies me. I can't relax, I can't focus, and it's been seven or eight months since I've had any meaningful hope for the future.

I don't regret getting that first shot at all. I decided not to get the second shot with my doctor's support, because I've been so unwell that they say my body needs a break. I was hospitalized for a rapid heartbeat and chest pain 2 weeks ago which I was told is pleurisy. The pain has only gotten worse, but the doctor told me that it will eventually go away. I can't drive anymore because I don't have the strength in my arms to navigate the steering wheel. I can't even pick up a water glass with one hand. I sleep 3 or 4 hours a nite because the pain keeps waking me up. I made the tough decision today to withdraw from school this term because I just feel so delirious a lot of the time now that my brain can't do it.

I (22f) got my first shot of Biontech last week and so did my sister. My mom is fully vaccinated with Moderna. My stepdad received his first shot of Biontech two days ago. But we also have two kids (age 5 and 3) in our family. Obviously they can't get vaccinated. Hearing that Delta is very transmissible, and often even infects vaccinated folk, scares me. I know efficiency of the vaccines was never 100% but I believed at least we'd be safe from Covid when we get vaccinated. I work full-time and go to school. At school, everyone wears a mask, we are 1,5m apart, the windows are open and everyone gets tested daily. At work, my coworker wears a mask and so do I. When I eat or drink I go outside. Otherwise, I don't take off my mask at all (I wear FFP2 or FFP3). My boss doesn't wear a mask but he only occasionally comes into our office. Also, everyone at my work place had Corona three months ago except me. They caught Alpha (B117). I also have to take public transit. Everyone wears masks. Windows are open. How big is my risk of infection? I have been getting regularly tested since March 21 (1 to 4 times a week) and it came back negative all the time, even when we had a high national incidence and infection was more likely. National incidence is now 5 cases per 100.000 people. In my town it is 3 cases per 100.000 people. At the moment, we have 49 active cases (my town is huge; 500.000 people live here).

Basically, it's fun and cool stuff like woodshop, building electronics, etc. So I signed up for that class for both Grade 9 and 10. Well, since my school has a semester system I got this course in Semester 2, which amazingly began at the beginning of March 2020. So boom, couldn't do this course. Then in Grade 10 we had this \"hybrid\" model of learning, some days virtual education some days in-person education. Well, due to my school being concerned about the tools having germs on them, the course was cancelled. Now, as of September 2021, I'm in Grade 11. I amazingly had this course at the exact wrong time. I contacted my school to allow me to take this course this year but they didn't make an exception.

FWIW, I also live thousands of miles from all of my family. My anxiety got pretty bad several months ago during the holidays when Covid was at its peak and was impossible to see people. I was also still furloughed from work and had a lot of time to think (and overthink). Ive dealt with mild anxiety in the past but nothing like this. During that time it got so bad that I drove thousands of miles to be with relatives. I was able to spend time with them in the evenings which was really helpful and eventually I felt back to normal for the most part. Since then Ive also gotten my job back.

My anxiety is always bad in the mornings; I dont get a lot of sleep because of it which makes it difficult to focus at work. Also, my anxiety gives me get bad stomach aches and I lose my appetite so it makes it really hard to eat. I usually have to force myself to eat every day which just isnt fun. My work is partially opened up and Ive been trying to go in at least a few hours a day just to be around other humans. That helps for sure. Ive been trying to take early morning bike rides as soon as I get up and that typically helps but in the few hours before work starts, Im still rather anxious.

I tried antidepressants (SSRIs) for about 6 months or so and they made my anxiety worse at first and I didnt feel like they were super helpful after that.

While the last year and a half have been trying emotionally and professionally for all of us, things are looking up with the vaccine. However, my wife's parents refuse to get vaccinated. They are not in great health and my father-in-law specifically is older and I worry about his health. Therefore, even as things have started to open up, my family has been relatively more conservative, with no masks-free indoor interaction outside of the family, even with people that are vaccinated, for fear of spreading the virus to my inlaws. This is becoming a big problem because I am building a startup and my cofounder is someone I met during the pandemic. He and I need to start building a more regular working cadence and relationship, but this is really difficult since my wife and SIL are not comfortable with me working in person with him, even though he is vaccinated (though he is much less careful than us). For my part, I would like to push the company forward, and agree that our creative work would improve if we were able to work in-person a couple of times per week. I'm just at a loss - my wife is grieving what she perceives as the loss of her parents' sanity and doesn't want to cut them off, but I face real professional challenges (let alone the ongoing personal and mental health challenges) from continuing the status quo.

{"Reddit ID": "oga1in", "Reddit Post": "This lockdown has gone on forever. From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to. I feel like I've become so negative that I don't want to share my thoughts with people because I will bring them down, and I already feel like I pushed some people away by doing this. I emailed multiple psychiatrists, but only one answered me and had one short appointment, and told me I should continue looking because he doesn't have time for new patients. I spend most of my time trying to get the motivation to work but failing, and looking at vaccination percentages and restrictions around the world hoping to see them improve and thinking about where else can be better than here.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_covid19_support", "Model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", "reappraisal_output_dim_1": "It's understandable that the narrator is feeling overwhelmed and stressed by the current situation in Munich.

A small part of this is too ensure that if I'm on the bike and my number comes up, the last thing I've said to them is the most important thing that needs to be said.\n\nI don't think I can do this anymore.

My back was turned for, perhaps, two seconds. Yet he managed to roll off the bed.\n\n* He landed on his belly.\n\n* He started howling immediately.\n\n* I immediately picked him up and soothed him. After ten or fifteen seconds, he calmed right down. Breastfed just fine. Was laughing and smiling before bed.\n\n* We did a pupil dilation check with a flashlight several times yesterday and today and he seemed normal. Rotated his limbs and checked for any swelling or sensitivity. All was fine. Sleep was normal.\n\nHow long do I need to be terrified? How can I tell if this has retarded my kid?
