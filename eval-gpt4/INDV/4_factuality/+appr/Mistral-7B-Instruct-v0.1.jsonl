I have a bit of a problem and I'm not sure if this is correlated with a narcissistic perception due to ASD, but everyone who I encounter in my life that wrongs me or humiliates me, I write down their names and I keep these names stored with me for a very long time. I've been thinking about applying for a university course for computer programming and solely the reason why I am contemplating to take this course is because I have a grandiose fantasy where I'd track down the location of these individuals to allegedly kidnap them and take them to my garage where I'd tie them up to a chair, show in front of them on a projected screen their wrongdoing to me and deliberately starving them to death while playing Three Little Birds by Bob Marley on a radio next to them. This process would apply to anyone in my life that had carried out any perceived injustices against me, making me a notorious serial killer.\n\nI came to this subreddit just hours after posting on r/ontario a self-explanatory question I was humiliated for (which I deleted the post shortly thereafter) and had wrote down the usernames of all individuals involved that I perceived as hostile, it's been racing through my head all afternoon and I have been institutionalized twice for indulging in serial killer fantasies, but do not have a recorded history of violence and I grew up in a well family household without parental abuse. I consulted with my psychiatrist last month and he says it is typical to engage in homicidal fantasies when under the influence of medications and taking into account my cognitive diagnosis.\n\nWould anyone else be able to explain these homicidal ideations?", "Sub-Reddit": "r_anger", "Model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", "reappraisal_output_dim_1": "It is important for the narrator to recognize that their thoughts and actions are not always rational or healthy.

Hi I have social anxiety and I was wondering, there's this girl that occasionally walks past me in the hallway and we were classmates for one year in a class and I have tried to initiate contact with her. She actually said she liked me 2 years prior (we have 1.5 years of online school), but I ghosted her which was very dumb and entirely my fault. I have miserably failed because of my social anxiety around her. My heart races and my mind goes blank with hesitation every time I'm around her. I haven't really talked to her for 2 years, so I am thinking that I would come off as a creep if I were to talk to her. And she typically walks at a 4mph rate, with arms crossed, looking down, so I don't really know if randomly saying hello would come off as weird or not, or if she doesn't even see me.

And Xanax never did anything to me besides brutally kill my appetite.\n\nAmbien on the other hand... ignoring the part where we get crazy and do stuff that we will regret later, like texting an old crush and asking him on a date (yeah, I had the date... today, btw! oh well, it was fast)... so, what I was saying is that the good part of Ambien is that you feel some kind of freedom and a really peaceful state of mind.\n\nLSD gave me the closest to what I should feel to be the happiest... but only during the trip. But then there's a problem: you can never know what your next trip will be like. And from paradise I went to pure nightmare (ER and shit). So I don't feel like trying it again even microdosing - same goes for shrooms. And weed... yeah, it's pleasurable and shit, but I don't know how it would be if I use it in long term.\n\nI'm thinking more of a controlled substance for now, aimed for anxiety and is similar to what Ambien does.

It ended up working and she became really friendly! Ended up brushing up against me everywhere, licked my hand (no open wound), and other things like that. At some point, i think she was trying to lick me again but i felt her tooth on my leg. No bite mark, but what I think might be a pimple on my leg, idfk lmao, and thus no blood (however i keep noticing stories of people who get rabies from seemingly invisible bite marks, but those are from bats, not cats). \n\nAt first, I was fine... and then I looked up \"rabies\" on Google, and here I am 8 hours later still researching it. I remember looking up symptoms of rabies while the cat was just chilling there lol. Anyway, I read a bunch of shit. The cat looked friendly, like any normal outdoor cat. It was a little shy around new people but got accustomed to you if you gave it the chance to. \n\nI honestly don't think I have it, but I have this compulsion to read and read until the feeling is numb and i get fatigued.

I have always been the type to not be able to eat when I was anxious. Everyone thought it was weird which only made it worse because I now I'm caring what people think about me. Fast forward and I'm now with my wife of 5 years. I'll have random episodes when I choke up and feel like gagging when I eat but I have NOTHING to be anxious about. I honestly only feel this way when we are going out to eat with her family. Or with some of my family that I don't see often. But I love her family. We have lived together and always been around each other since we started dating . So why I'm the hell do I still get anxiety when they call us and ask us to dinner or to come over? Sometimes I can do it with no problems. But other times I feel like I'm going to throw up. Even when I know I'm hungry. It sucks so bad.

{"Reddit ID": "Anxiety_111", "Reddit Post": "Just wanted to share with someone that I filed my tax return all on my own!\n\nFor those outside England a quick simplified brief on our tax system.  If you work for an employer they normally work out how much tax etc you owe and it's deducted at source so what you get in your pay check is yours. But if you're self employed you have to fill in a tax return each year. You can fill in the return from the 6th April and it has to be done by 31st January the following year. So the tax return I've just submitted is for tax year 2020-2021.\n\nI hate doing my tax return. My accounts are really simple, profits easy to calculate and very few expenses. But I'm so paranoid I'll do something wrong. There's so many different fields to fill in and I have no clue what half of them mean. I've always asked my sister to sit with me in the past when I do my returns but this year I did it all on my own.\n\nTo further complicate matters my accounts last year are screwed up because of coronavirus. My income was down ~75% but I was eligible for a government support scheme called the Self Employment Income Support Scheme. However I then had to declare all these figures on my tax returns which was even more boxes to tick.\n\nI also had to claim my fifth grant which means working out my turnover for the last two years etc. and freaking out that I'll somehow claim the wrong amount or screw something up.\n\nIt took me two weeks of staring at the folder to build up the courage and then about half an hour ago I finally hit that sweet spot of the anxiety of not doing it outweighing the anxiety of doing it (the grant deadline is September). So here I am just after midnight waiting for the anxiety adrenaline rush to die down so I can actually get some sleep.\n\nBut I did it! I just needed to share with someone as I'm really proud of myself.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_anxiety", "Model": "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1", "reappraisal_output_dim_1": "<likert>5</likert><rationale>It's important to remember that filing a tax return is a necessary part of being self-employed, and while it may seem daunting, it's not uncommon to feel anxious about it.

Add that to all the Israelis who have attained natural immunity from the virus, and the percentage rate of immunity within Israel arrives at roughly 66%. For a group to have herd immunity to COVID-19, 70% must be immune. Because Israel has yet to achieve herd immunity, it is still possible for an outbreak to take place.

I've read about different forms \"long Covid\" takes - it's not always persistent - some report reinfection or reactivation of Covid after periods of dormancy. Two weeks after my initial reactivation, my symptoms begin to subside. I decide to get the first Covid vaccine (I read that in some \"vaccine vanguard\" countries like Israel, they were recommending one covid shot for those who had already had the virus). I get the first shot, and feel a little not great for about 48 hours or so (mild discomfort in lymph nodes, some fatigue, weakness), but afterwards I begin to feel great, better than I had at any point since before I got Covid in early May. A week ago I put in a full exercise. About 24 hours later, I don't feel like I felt when I had Covid, but I definitely feel the exact same as I did *after* I had gotten my first shot - mild discomfort in lymph nodes, some weakness. I am under the impression working out a second time \"reactivated\" dormant Covid, but the vaccine kicked back in and enlisted my immune system in fighting this second activation. Finding information about the virus at this time has been so frustrating - official counsel has lagged internet anecdotes and similar by a considerable amount of time.

I've been doing a lot of thinking, lately, and I think I've finally got a handle on why the pandemic has been so chronically stressful for me, and others, over the past year. Specifically those in first world countries, in relation to how it affects us on a psychological level. As people, we tend to experience bad things as happening suddenly, all at once, and then you deal with them. A broken leg, a car wreak, getting fired, getting dumped, etc. Deeply unpleasant, but relatively short-duration things. These are type-1 and type-2 problems; Things which can be avoided, or which can be fixed. But the Coronavirus has loaded us all down with the third type of problem. The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part. Lots of us weren't doing too great before the pandemic hit, but then, after 15 months of slow, grinding lockdowns, endless bad news on top of bad news, and nowhere to go to get away from it... Is it really a wonder why everyone is so unhappy all the time? I feel like a machine that's trying harder and harder to run without lubricant, to the point that it's just scraping metal-on-metal, and every day is a bit harder than the last. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to keep this up. The possibility of a variant wave in the Fall, forcing us back into yet another lockdown, terrifies me. I can't relax, I can't focus, and it's been seven or eight months since I've had any meaningful hope for the future.

I know efficiency of the vaccines was never 100% but I believed at least we'd be safe from Covid when we get vaccinated. I work full-time and go to school. At school, everyone wears a mask, we are 1,5m apart, the windows are open and everyone gets tested daily. At work, my coworker wears a mask and so do I. When I eat or drink I go outside. Otherwise, I don't take off my mask at all (I wear FFP2 or FFP3). My boss doesn't wear a mask but he only occasionally comes into our office. Also, everyone at my work place had Corona three months ago except me. They caught Alpha (B117). I also have to take public transit. Everyone wears masks. Windows are open.

I have been getting regularly tested since March 21 (1 to 4 times a week) and it came back negative all the time, even when we had a high national incidence and infection was more likely.

FWIW, I also live thousands of miles from all of my family. My anxiety got pretty bad several months ago during the holidays when Covid was at its peak and was impossible to see people.

I haven't met such a big group since last summer. Only smaller groups and always outdoors. You can probably tell by now that I'm a very careful person when it comes to dealing with the virus. I always followed my principles. Right know I'm going back and fourth whether I should go or not. Is it still okay to apply the precautionary principle here and not attend? I mean I'm 3 weeks out from being fully vaccinated. Everyone else there is in a spirit to party because we couldn't for so long. I'm not having that feeling. Quite the opposite.

My forearms became incredibly itchy for about 2-3 days, but I never developed a rash or anything of the sorts.

While the last year and a half have been trying emotionally and professionally for all of us, things are looking up with the vaccine. However, my wife's parents refuse to get vaccinated. They are not in great health and my father-in-law specifically is older and I worry about his health. Therefore, even as things have started to open up, my family has been relatively more conservative, with no masks-free indoor interaction outside of the family, even with people that are vaccinated, for fear of spreading the virus to my inlaws. This is becoming a big problem because I am building a startup and my cofounder is someone I met during the pandemic. He and I need to start building a more regular working cadence and relationship, but this is really difficult since my wife and SIL are not comfortable with me working in person with him, even though he is vaccinated (though he is much less careful than us). For my part, I would like to push the company forward, and agree that our creative work would improve if we were able to work in-person a couple of times per week. I'm just at a loss - my wife is grieving what she perceives as the loss of her parents' sanity and doesn't want to cut them off, but I face real professional challenges (let alone the ongoing personal and mental health challenges) from continuing the status quo. Guiltily, I feel very angry at them - I feel like they are offloading responsibility for their safety on my wife, SIL, and myself, which seems extremely selfish.

From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to.
