This has not only caused me and my family hundreds of dollars of damages, but I also usually get hurt in the process. Sure, wounds can heal, but having them in the first place because of a mental breakdown because my pen has dried out is a pretty fucked up thing in my book. \n\nI tried putting said things down before starting to hit something, but I just have zero self control and can't consistently do so. I also tried calming myself down by just staying still and doing nothing, but that usually gets me even more angry and I cause more harm to myself.

It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh. \n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, \"oh hes not that,\" and move on.

I have miserably failed because of my social anxiety around her. My heart races and my mind goes blank with hesitation every time I'm around her. I haven't really talked to her for 2 years, so I am thinking that I would come off as a creep if I were to talk to her. And she typically walks at a 4mph rate, with arms crossed, looking down, so I don't really know if randomly saying hello would come off as weird or not, or if she doesn't even see me. She is sorta anti-social, yet dresses very nicely with makeup and jewelry. I was just wondering if randomly saying hi to her after 2 years would be creepy? And, I would also really appreciate some tips.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_anxiety", "Model": "gpt-4-turbo", "reappraisal_output_dim_1": "Reappraising the situation, it's important to recognize that while you may have made a mistake in the past by ghosting her, this does not define your future interactions.

However I then had to declare all these figures on my tax returns which was even more boxes to tick.\n\nI also had to claim my fifth grant which means working out my turnover for the last two years etc. and freaking out that I'll somehow claim the wrong amount or screw something up.\n\nIt took me two weeks of staring at the folder to build up the courage and then about half an hour ago I finally hit that sweet spot of the anxiety of not doing it outweighing the anxiety of doing it (the grant deadline is September). So here I am just after midnight waiting for the anxiety adrenaline rush to die down so I can actually get some sleep.\n\nBut I did it!

Add that to all the Israelis who have attained natural immunity from the virus, and the percentage rate of immunity within Israel arrives at roughly 66%. For a group to have herd immunity to COVID-19, 70% must be immune. Because Israel has yet to achieve herd immunity, it is still possible for an outbreak to take place.

I've been doing a lot of thinking, lately, and I think I've finally got a handle on why the pandemic has been so chronically stressful for me, and others, over the past year. Specifically those in first world countries, in relation to how it affects us on a psychological level. As people, we tend to experience bad things as happening suddenly, all at once, and then you deal with them. A broken leg, a car wreak, getting fired, getting dumped, etc. Deeply unpleasant, but relatively short-duration things. These are type-1 and type-2 problems; Things which can be avoided, or which can be fixed. But the Coronavirus has loaded us all down with the third type of problem. The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part. Lots of us weren't doing too great before the pandemic hit, but then, after 15 months of slow, grinding lockdowns, endless bad news on top of bad news, and nowhere to go to get away from it... Is it really a wonder why everyone is so unhappy all the time? I feel like a machine that's trying harder and harder to run without lubricant, to the point that it's just scraping metal-on-metal, and every day is a bit harder than the last. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to keep this up. The possibility of a variant wave in the Fall, forcing us back into yet another lockdown, terrifies me. I can't relax, I can't focus, and it's been seven or eight months since I've had any meaningful hope for the future.

I (22f) got my first shot of Biontech last week and so did my sister. My mom is fully vaccinated with Moderna. My stepdad received his first shot of Biontech two days ago. But we also have two kids (age 5 and 3) in our family. Obviously they can't get vaccinated. Hearing that Delta is very transmissible, and often even infects vaccinated folk, scares me. I know efficiency of the vaccines was never 100% but I believed at least we'd be safe from Covid when we get vaccinated. I work full-time and go to school. At school, everyone wears a mask, we are 1,5m apart, the windows are open and everyone gets tested daily. At work, my coworker wears a mask and so do I. When I eat or drink I go outside. Otherwise, I don't take off my mask at all (I wear FFP2 or FFP3). My boss doesn't wear a mask but he only occasionally comes into our office. Also, everyone at my work place had Corona three months ago except me. They caught Alpha (B117). I also have to take public transit. Everyone wears masks. Windows are open. How big is my risk of infection? I have been getting regularly tested since March 21 (1 to 4 times a week) and it came back negative all the time, even when we had a high national incidence and infection was more likely. National incidence is now 5 cases per 100.000 people. In my town it is 3 cases per 100.000 people. At the moment, we have 49 active cases (my town is huge; 500.000 people live here).

Everything was looking pretty hopeful a few months ago, but since the last lockdown rules started easing, cases and hospitalisations have started rising again, even though we're doing pretty well with vaccinations. Our Government have handled the pandemic pretty poorly throughout and managed to let the Delta variant in with their loose border control measures. It just feels like this never ending cycle of rising cases, lockdown, falling cases, lift lockdown, rising cases again, etc etc and I'm terrified of going into another lockdown in the Autumn. I can't do it again. We keep saying the lockdowns are to protect our (underfunded) NHS from being overwhelmed but if hospitalisations are already getting too high now in the SUMMER, how the hell will they cope with a Winter wave with not only COVID cases but also a new wave of Flu cases which have been low the last year because of the lockdowns??? I feel guilty for complaining as I know other people have it much worse, and having already had the virus, it's not affected me all that badly. But the restrictions have meant I can no longer do my job (musician), I can't meet a partner, I've lost all hope for the future and I just feel like I'm waiting for the next bit of bad news. If the vaccines aren't enough for getting us out of this shit, what will be???? I just don't feel like life is worth living anymore under these restrictions.

While the last year and a half have been trying emotionally and professionally for all of us, things are looking up with the vaccine. However, my wife's parents refuse to get vaccinated. They are not in great health and my father-in-law specifically is older and I worry about his health. Therefore, even as things have started to open up, my family has been relatively more conservative, with no masks-free indoor interaction outside of the family, even with people that are vaccinated, for fear of spreading the virus to my inlaws.

This past year has been upsetting to her, though.\n\nUp until about a year ago she spent her days with her grandparents. Then they left the country for a while, and she started daycare, which she enjoyed... she had no issues being away from us all day. Her grandparents came back in February, and at the same time, her little brother was born. She went back to staying with the grandparents during the day for the whole spring; then in the summer, grandparents had to leave again. During the summer she started to throw tantrums, especially around eating, but we took it in stride, dealt with it, and things got better. She doesn't do that anymore, though like a lot of kids she just doesn't like to eat much. But she gets enough nutrition.\n\nHer grandparents (who live with us) have been back again since September, and ever since, she panics whenever grandma leaves the room, unless it's just part of her routine.

In the midst of crying, my daughter sprinted across the room and tripped, of course prompting sympathy from grandma.

If she shows signs of distress, you can comfort her in other ways, such as cuddling or a favorite toy, to help her transition smoothly.", "evaluation_raw_output_dim_7": "Yes", "reappraisal_output_dim_8": "You have a good understanding of your daughter's current attachment to the pacifier and are aware of her needs, which is a great starting point. You can use this knowledge to gradually introduce changes. Since she's not using the pacifier all the time, you might begin by limiting its use to sleep times and moments of distress. This can help her learn to self-soothe without it during other parts of the day. Remember, you can adjust your approach based on her response, which shows you have the ability to guide the process effectively.", "evaluation_raw_output_dim_8": "Yes", "reappraisal_output_dim_23": "Reappraising the situation, it's important to consider that the decision to wean your child off the pacifier is a common parenting challenge and not a reflection of your personal values. It's a practical issue that involves timing and method. Since your daughter is not heavily dependent on the pacifier, you might find it easier to gradually reduce its use, starting by limiting it to sleep times and moments of distress. This approach can align with a gentle parenting style, respecting both your child's current needs and the goal of eventually removing the pacifier.", "evaluation_raw_output_dim_23": "Yes"}

I figured it would never happen because they're very expensive and with two young kids on a single income, there was no way.  \n\nThen, a local boudoir photographer ran a contest where the winner gets a full set of photos and prints.  She's promised to do a full boudoir shoot for me if she wins this contest, and I could really use your support.\n\nThe winner is decided by Facebook \"Likes\", and I'd really appreciate the support of some fellow new parents.  I think it took a lot of guts to do this 6 months after having a baby, and it would mean a lot to her to win (she says she doesn't feel \"sexy\" anymore). \n\nedit: Thanks very much for all your support and nice comments!\n\nIf you wouldn't mind, could you help me show her she IS still sexy by \"Liking\" [this photo?](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=361522470538796&amp;set=a.361522117205498.90549.112331498791229&amp;type=1&amp;theater)\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention the pics are not nude, she's wearing panties and a shirt.
