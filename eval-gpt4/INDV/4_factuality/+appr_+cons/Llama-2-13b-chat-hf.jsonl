When I get there I tell the lady and ask why I'm here essentially why can't they just deliver to my fucking door. She says that it'd take the workers too long to do that because our complex gets so many packages. I'm soo annoyed. I feel inconvenienced because of the drive there and how absolutely unnecessary this is. It's like the residents are being punished because we order packages. Ridiculous. This always happens when I'm inconvenienced and know that others are in the wrong. I get even more pissed because I try to do the right thing when it comes to others and feel the lack of communication between my apartment managers and the USPS shows complete disregard for the residents. When I'm like this I stay mad for way too long. I don't react violently but I definitely take out my anger on those around me. I find it hard to get off the subject or talk about something else. \n\nAnyone else deal with this or have any advice for me?", "Sub-Reddit": "r_anger", "Model": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "reappraisal_output_dim_1": "Sure, I'd be happy to help the narrator reappraise the situation.

This might involve talking to a trusted friend or family member about how they're feeling, or seeking out professional help from a therapist or counselor.\n2. Seek help from others: The narrator may find it helpful to talk to someone who can offer support and guidance. This could be a close friend or family member, or a mental health professional.\n3. Take a mental break: If the narrator is feeling overwhelmed, it may be helpful to take a step back and give themselves some space to recharge. This could involve taking a break from social media or other stressors, or engaging in a relaxing activity like exercise or meditation.\n4. Re-evaluate the situation: Once the narrator has taken some time to recharge, they may want to re-evaluate the situation and consider whether there are any steps they can take to address the root causes of their anger and frustration.

Based on their self-assessment of being \"somewhat responsible\" for their anger issues, it seems that they are already taking some responsibility for their actions. However, it might be helpful for them to re-evaluate their responsibility level and consider the following points:\n\n* It's normal to feel frustrated or angry when things don't go as planned or when others make mistakes. It's important to recognize that these feelings are natural and don't define your entire personality.\n* The narrator mentions that their anger is \"dead quick\" and that they often walk away from the situation to calm down. This suggests that they may be taking some steps to manage their anger, but could potentially benefit from additional strategies.\n* It's possible that the narrator's anger is a result of underlying stress or anxiety, rather than a personal failing. Considering the source of their anger and addressing any underlying issues may help reduce the intensity of their emotions.\n\nTo help the narrator reappraise the situation, I would suggest the following guidelines:\n\n1. Practice self-compassion: Recognize that it's okay to feel angry or frustrated, and that these emotions don't define your entire personality.\n2. Identify triggers: Keep a journal or log of when you feel angry or frustrated, and try to identify any common triggers or patterns.\n3.

Re-evaluate priorities: The narrator may need to re-evaluate their priorities and expectations around gaming.

I think it's important to remember that everyone has different strengths and weaknesses, and just because you may not be as skilled at something as you'd like, it doesn't mean you're not a decent person. In fact, it takes a lot of courage to admit when we're struggling and to ask for help, which it sounds like you're doing.\n\nIt's also worth considering that when we're in situations where we're interacting with others, there can be conflicts of internal values. What we value may not always be suitable for the situation, and it's important to be able to communicate amicably with others, especially if the situation aligns with our beliefs. However, if the situation contradicts our beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others' perspectives.\n\nFor example, if you firmly believe that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. But, it's also important to recognize that not everyone may share that belief, and that's okay. It's important to be understanding and respectful of others' perspectives, even if they differ from our own.\n\nSo, instead of beating yourself up over your gaming experiences, try to focus on the things that you do well and the things that bring you joy. And, if you find that your gaming experiences are still causing you distress, it may be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor about how to manage your emotions and develop healthy coping strategies.\n\nI hope this helps!

However, taking responsibility for their actions may not be necessary. Instead of getting angry or retaliating, try to focus on your driving and ignore their behavior. If you find yourself in a difficult situation, try to stay calm and patiently work your way out of it.

Communicate assertively: If someone has done something that bothers you, calmly and assertively express your feelings to them. Use \"I\" statements to describe how you feel and avoid blaming or attacking language.\n5. Set boundaries: If someone is consistently disrespecting you, it may be time to set boundaries or distance yourself from the situation.\n\nRemember that you can't control how others behave, but you can control how you respond to them.

This may not be easy, but it's an important step in addressing the issue and finding a solution.\n2. Seek help from others: The narrator could talk to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional about their feelings and get some support and guidance.

Take a mental break: If the situation becomes too overwhelming, the narrator could take a break and focus on taking care of themselves.

It's important to remember that it's completely normal to feel angry with your family sometimes, and it doesn't mean that you don't love them or value your relationship with them. In fact, it's often a sign that you care deeply about them and want to communicate your needs and boundaries.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that conflicts of internal values can arise in situations where multiple people interact. Just because you value being a good daughter and not wanting to lose your family members, it doesn't mean that you have to suppress your own emotions and needs in order to maintain the relationship. Instead, it's important to communicate amicably with your family and try to find a solution that works for everyone.\n\nRemember that it's okay to have different perspectives and beliefs within a family, and it's important to respect and understand each other's viewpoints. Just because you don't agree on everything doesn't mean that you can't maintain a healthy and loving relationship.\n\nSo, instead of beating yourself up over feeling angry, try to reframe your emotions as a normal and natural response to a difficult situation. It's okay to feel angry, and it's important to communicate your needs and boundaries in a respectful and assertive way. Remember that you can still love and value your family members while also setting boundaries and taking care of yourself.", "evaluation_raw_output_dim_23": "Yes"}

Based on the information provided, it seems that the narrator's anger issues are causing them to feel overwhelmed and out of control. Here are a few suggestions for how the narrator might reappraise the situation and regain control:\n\n1. Seek professional help: The narrator mentions that they have a tendency to yell at people, especially their family, and feel awful afterward. This suggests that they may be struggling with a lack of impulse control and anger management. Consider seeking the help of a therapist or counselor who can provide guidance on how to manage anger in a healthy way.\n2. Practice self-care: The narrator mentions that they spend hours bashing themselves for every little thing they do wrong. This suggests that they may be struggling with negative self-talk and low self-esteem. Consider practicing self-care activities such as meditation, exercise, or journaling to help improve self-esteem and reduce stress.\n3. Set boundaries: The narrator mentions that they feel exhausted after interacting with people. This suggests that they may be taking on too much or allowing others to take advantage of them. Consider setting boundaries with others to protect your own time and energy.\n4. Take a break: The narrator mentions that they feel overwhelmed and don't know what to do about their anger issues. This suggests that they may be feeling burnt out and in need of a break. Consider taking a mental break and engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation.\n\nOverall, it's important for the narrator to recognize that they are not alone in their struggles with anger and that there are resources available to help them regain control.

However, their anger issues and tendency to snap at family members are inconsistent with their values of respect and control.\n\nTo reappraise the situation, it's important to recognize that conflicts of internal values can arise in situations where multiple people interact. While the narrator's values are important, they may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital, especially when the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. However, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others' perspectives.\n\nFor example, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. However, they should also be aware that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge. By recognizing these potential conflicts and being open to different perspectives, the narrator can better navigate challenging situations and find more effective ways to communicate and resolve conflicts.", "evaluation_raw_output_dim_23": "Minor Error"}

Develop a detailed plan: Once you've identified the specific aspects of the issue that are within your control, develop a detailed plan to tackle each one. This could be as simple as a to-do list of things you can do to manage your anger, such as taking a deep breath before reacting or finding a healthy outlet for your emotions.\n4. Seek support: If you feel overwhelmed by the situation, don't be afraid to seek support from friends and family. Talking to someone about your struggles can help you feel empowered and provide you with a fresh perspective on the situation.\n5. Find joy in the small victories: As you work on managing your anger, try to find joy in the small victories. For example, if you successfully avoid breaking an object one day, take pride in that accomplishment and strike it off your to-do list. This can help you feel empowered and motivated to continue working on the issue.\n\nRemember, managing anger is a process and it may take time to see significant improvements.

I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk.

It's normal to feel overwhelmed in certain situations, and it's okay to take steps to protect yourself and manage your emotions.\n\nOne way to do this might be to identify the situations or triggers that cause you the most anxiety, and then find ways to avoid or limit your exposure to them. For example, if going to nail appointments or college classes makes you feel particularly anxious, you might consider finding alternative ways to take care of your nails or complete your coursework.\n\nAdditionally, it might be helpful to practice some coping strategies to help you manage your anxiety in the moment. This could include deep breathing, physical exercise, or talking to a trusted friend or therapist about how you're feeling.\n\nRemember that it's okay to take things one step at a time, and to prioritize your own well-being and self-care.

For example, you might start by identifying the specific situations or triggers that cause your anxiety.\n2. Break down the problem into manageable steps: Once you have identified the specific aspects of your anxiety that you would like to address, start breaking down each problem into smaller, more manageable steps. For example, if you are anxious about public speaking, you might start by practicing in front of a small group of friends or family members.\n3. Develop a detailed plan: Once you have broken down the problem into smaller steps, develop a detailed plan for tackling each aspect. This might involve setting specific goals, such as \"I will practice public speaking for 30 minutes every day for the next week.\"\n4. Seek support from friends and family: If you feel overwhelmed by the scope of the issue, don't be afraid to seek support from friends and family. Talking through your anxiety with someone you trust can be a helpful way to gain perspective and feel more in control.\n5.

I understand that you're feeling anxious about how to express your feelings to the girl you like, and you're worried that your message might come across as weird or insincere. It's totally normal to feel this way, especially when it comes to communication in situations where multiple people are involved.\n\nIt's important to remember that conflicts of internal values can arise in these situations, and what you value might not always be suitable depending on the context. However, communicating amicably with others is vital, especially if the situation aligns with your beliefs.\n\nIn your case, it seems like you have been listening to the girl's struggles and have been affected by them, which aligns with your personal values of being supportive and caring. Your draft message shows that you have been paying attention to her and are genuinely concerned about her well-being.\n\nHowever, your anxiety about how to express your feelings might indicate some inconsistency with your values of being confident and assertive. It's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others' perspectives.\n\nFor instance, if you firmly believe that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. But, you should also be aware that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\nSo, take a deep breath and remember that it's okay to feel anxious in these situations. Just be true to yourself, and communicate your feelings in a way that feels authentic and respectful to both you and the girl you like. Good luck!", "evaluation_raw_output_dim_23": "Minor Error"}

It ended up working and she became really friendly! Ended up brushing up against me everywhere, licked my hand (no open wound), and other things like that. At some point, i think she was trying to lick me again but i felt her tooth on my leg. No bite mark, but what I think might be a pimple on my leg, idfk lmao, and thus no blood (however i keep noticing stories of people who get rabies from seemingly invisible bite marks, but those are from bats, not cats). \n\nAt first, I was fine... and then I looked up \"rabies\" on Google, and here I am 8 hours later still researching it. I remember looking up symptoms of rabies while the cat was just chilling there lol. Anyway, I read a bunch of shit. The cat looked friendly, like any normal outdoor cat. It was a little shy around new people but got accustomed to you if you gave it the chance to. \n\nI honestly don't think I have it, but I have this compulsion to read and read until the feeling is numb and i get fatigued.

Recognize that the cat's friendly behavior was not solely due to your actions. Cats are social animals and may initiate contact with humans based on their own instincts and experiences.\n2. Acknowledge that seeking interaction with the cat was a reasonable and harmless decision. You did not provoke or threaten the cat in any way.\n3. Consider the possibility that the cat's tooth brushing against your leg was an innocuous behavior and not a sign of aggression. Cats often use their teeth and tongues to groom themselves and others.\n4. Realize that your fear of rabies is understandable, but it's important to keep things in perspective. Rabies is a rare disease, and the risk of transmission from a cat is even lower.\n5. Take comfort in the fact that you have taken precautions by washing your hand and avoiding contact with the cat until you could get medical advice.\n\nBy reappraising the situation in this way, the narrator can reduce their level of responsibility and worry, and focus on seeking medical advice and taking appropriate precautions to ensure their health and safety.", "evaluation_raw_output_dim_1": "Yes", "reappraisal_output_dim_4": "Sure, here's my response in the format requested:\n\n<Likert>2</Likert>\n\nThe narrator thought they were able to cope with the consequences of the event to some extent.\n\n<Rationale>\nThe narrator was able to brush off the incident at first, but then became consumed by researching rabies after looking up symptoms online.

This has gotten so bad I'm unable to work, socialize with friends and family, or do something as simple as take my dog for a walk. I am barely holding on and I can't handle much more of this. I was prescribed Cipralex a few months ago and I only took that for a few days because medication is one of the many things that give me anxiety, and than I search every little thing and scare myself into even feeling sick. Today I was prescribed sertraline, and I even went to pick it up and it's in my medicine cabinet now.

Focus on what you can control: Instead of worrying about 500 steps ahead, focus on what you can control in the present moment. Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, and take action on the ones that are most important.\n3. Practice self-compassion: Remember that it's okay to make mistakes and that you are doing the best you can. Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, just as you would a close friend.\n4. Seek support: Reach out to trusted friends, family, or a mental health professional for support and guidance. Talking through your thoughts and feelings with someone who cares about you can help you gain perspective and feel less overwhelmed.\n\nRemember, it's important to take responsibility for your actions and decisions, but it's also important to recognize when you are overestimating your level of control.

It's a daily occurrence of cursing and raging at his game and it stresses me out beyond belief. More than it should for what it is, I think. \n\nInstinctively I feel a strong urge to flee, to get away from the house, or his vicinity or even ending the relationship altogether because I feel I've reached my tolerance limit. \n\nI'd think that's how I usually get around people who are generally very emotional in a negative way - I want to flee from them and get them out of my life completely. Even when they're generally nice and good to me, this instance of being negative affects me to the point where I cannot see anything but it and not feel anything for them but... aversion? \n\nMaybe it's possible to go through life and avoid such people altogether, but I'm sure there are situations where you somehow just have to deal with it, being in a relationship at times or maybe in a workplace environment or with family members. \n\nI've asked him to stop many times, it's gotten better, a bit, but I don't think he'll ever stop, and I cannot control him or other people, so I'd like to find a way to control it within myself.

Recognize your boundaries: It's okay to set boundaries with your partner and communicate what you are and are not comfortable with. If you have asked your partner to stop raging during gaming and they have not, it may be time to re-evaluate what you are willing to tolerate.\n2. Practice self-care: Take care of yourself by engaging in activities that bring you joy and help you manage stress. This may include taking breaks from the situation, exercising, or talking to a trusted friend or therapist.\n3. Seek support: Consider talking to a therapist or trusted friend about your feelings and experiences. It can be helpful to have someone to talk to who can provide a neutral perspective and offer support.\n4. Reframe your thinking: Try to reframe your thinking around your partner's behavior. Instead of taking it personally or feeling responsible for it, try to see it as a temporary and manageable situation.\n5.

Recognize that you are not responsible for other people's actions: The narrator mentions that they were \"forced out\" of their previous position, but it's important to remember that other people's actions are not within our control. Instead of taking on responsibility for someone else's decision, try to focus on what you can control.\n2. Reframe your thinking about your health issues: The narrator mentions that their health issues \"absolutely crushed\" their confidence. While it's understandable to feel affected by health issues, try to reframe your thinking by acknowledging that your health issues do not define your worth or abilities.\n3. Focus on what you can control: Instead of worrying about things that are outside of your control, try to focus on what you can control. In the case of the narrator, they can control how they prepare for and perform in their new role.\n4. Practice self-compassion: The narrator mentions that they are \"insecure\" and \"hate talking about themselves.\" This suggests that they may be being too hard on themselves.

{"Reddit ID": "Anxiety_111", "Reddit Post": "Just wanted to share with someone that I filed my tax return all on my own!\n\nFor those outside England a quick simplified brief on our tax system.  If you work for an employer they normally work out how much tax etc you owe and it's deducted at source so what you get in your pay check is yours. But if you're self employed you have to fill in a tax return each year. You can fill in the return from the 6th April and it has to be done by 31st January the following year. So the tax return I've just submitted is for tax year 2020-2021.\n\nI hate doing my tax return. My accounts are really simple, profits easy to calculate and very few expenses. But I'm so paranoid I'll do something wrong. There's so many different fields to fill in and I have no clue what half of them mean. I've always asked my sister to sit with me in the past when I do my returns but this year I did it all on my own.\n\nTo further complicate matters my accounts last year are screwed up because of coronavirus. My income was down ~75% but I was eligible for a government support scheme called the Self Employment Income Support Scheme. However I then had to declare all these figures on my tax returns which was even more boxes to tick.\n\nI also had to claim my fifth grant which means working out my turnover for the last two years etc. and freaking out that I'll somehow claim the wrong amount or screw something up.\n\nIt took me two weeks of staring at the folder to build up the courage and then about half an hour ago I finally hit that sweet spot of the anxiety of not doing it outweighing the anxiety of doing it (the grant deadline is September).

I'd like to explain why these fears simply are not rational. Despite what some say, Israel has not achieved herd immunity. They are very close, of course, but they are not at that milestone *yet.* About 5,160,000 Israelis are fully vaccinated, equivalent to roughly 56% of the Israeli population is fully vaccinated. Add that to all the Israelis who have attained natural immunity from the virus, and the percentage rate of immunity within Israel arrives at roughly 66%. For a group to have herd immunity to COVID-19, 70% must be immune. Because Israel has yet to achieve herd immunity, it is still possible for an outbreak to take place.

{"Reddit ID": "o7y52c", "Reddit Post": "The following has been my experience: Started showing Covid symptoms at the beginning of May 2021. They lasted about two and a half weeks. After the third and a half week or so, I felt well enough to put in a full workout. I did so, and 48 hours later, my Covid symptoms had returned in pretty much full force. I've read about different forms \"long Covid\" takes - it's not always persistent - some report reinfection or reactivation of Covid after periods of dormancy. Two weeks after my initial reactivation, my symptoms begin to subside. I decide to get the first Covid vaccine (I read that in some \"vaccine vanguard\" countries like Israel, they were recommending one covid shot for those who had already had the virus). I get the first shot, and feel a little not great for about 48 hours or so (mild discomfort in lymph nodes, some fatigue, weakness), but afterwards I begin to feel great, better than I had at any point since before I got Covid in early May. A week ago I put in a full exercise. About 24 hours later, I don't feel like I felt when I had Covid, but I definitely feel the exact same as I did *after* I had gotten my first shot - mild discomfort in lymph nodes, some weakness. I am under the impression working out a second time \"reactivated\" dormant Covid, but the vaccine kicked back in and enlisted my immune system in fighting this second activation. Finding information about the virus at this time has been so frustrating - official counsel has lagged internet anecdotes and similar by a considerable amount of time. Does what I describe track with anyone's experience? I wonder for how long I'll be unable to exercise without precipitating unwanted flare-ups of Covid symptoms or Covid vaccine side effects.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_covid19_support", "Model": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "reappraisal_output_dim_1": "Based on your experience, it seems that you may be placing too much responsibility on yourself for the reactivation of your Covid symptoms after getting vaccinated. While your decision to get vaccinated may have contributed to the temporary increase in symptoms, it is important to remember that the vaccine was designed to help protect you against future Covid infections, not to cause harm or reactivate existing infections.\n\nIt is also important to note that the reactivation of Covid symptoms after exercise is not uncommon, and it does not necessarily mean that the vaccine is the cause. It is possible that your body was simply responding to the exercise in a way that is typical for someone who has previously had Covid.\n\nTo help you reappraise the situation, I would suggest focusing on the things that you can control, such as taking care of yourself and following the advice of medical professionals. Rather than placing blame or responsibility on yourself, try to focus on taking proactive steps to manage your symptoms and improve your overall health. This may include getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and following a healthy diet.\n\nAdditionally, it may be helpful to talk to your doctor or a medical professional about your experience and any concerns you may have.

Ask yourself, \"What can I control in this situation?\" and \"What are some small steps I can take to make things better for myself?\"\n\nAdditionally, it may be helpful to practice self-compassion and self-forgiveness. It's okay to make mistakes and have difficulties in life. Everyone does. Instead of beating yourself up over things that go wrong, try to offer yourself kindness and understanding. Remember that you are doing the best you can with the resources you have, and that is enough.\n\nFinally, it may be helpful to reach out to others for support.

{"Reddit ID": "o93rqd", "Reddit Post": "Hey, everyone, just in a particularly dark patch, and feeling the need for some dialogue. I've been doing a lot of thinking, lately, and I think I've finally got a handle on why the pandemic has been so chronically stressful for me, and others, over the past year. Specifically those in first world countries, in relation to how it affects us on a psychological level. As people, we tend to experience bad things as happening suddenly, all at once, and then you deal with them. A broken leg, a car wreak, getting fired, getting dumped, etc. Deeply unpleasant, but relatively short-duration things. These are type-1 and type-2 problems; Things which can be avoided, or which can be fixed. But the Coronavirus has loaded us all down with the third type of problem. The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part. Lots of us weren't doing too great before the pandemic hit, but then, after 15 months of slow, grinding lockdowns, endless bad news on top of bad news, and nowhere to go to get away from it... Is it really a wonder why everyone is so unhappy all the time? I feel like a machine that's trying harder and harder to run without lubricant, to the point that it's just scraping metal-on-metal, and every day is a bit harder than the last. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to keep this up. The possibility of a variant wave in the Fall, forcing us back into yet another lockdown, terrifies me. I can't relax, I can't focus, and it's been seven or eight months since I've had any meaningful hope for the future. This late in the game, I just... can't shake the feeling that things will never get better. 2019 was the best things will ever be in my lifetime, and it's all downhill from here.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_covid19_support", "Model": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "reappraisal_output_dim_1": "Sure, I'd be happy to help the narrator reappraise the situation!\n\nBased on the text, it seems that the narrator is feeling overwhelmed and responsible for the pandemic, but they are not entirely responsible for the situation.

You mentioned that you feel more comfortable breathing without a mask, so let's start there. What are some small steps you can take to continue feeling comfortable without a mask, even if others around you are wearing them? Maybe you can start by taking a few deep breaths when you're feeling anxious, or by finding a quiet space to relax when you need to.\n\nNext, let's think about what you can do to manage the situation if masks are reintroduced in your area. Instead of feeling overwhelmed by the possibility of new restrictions, can you break down the problem into smaller, more manageable steps? For example, you could start by researching the specific guidelines for your area, or by talking to friends or family members who have experience wearing masks.\n\nRemember, you don't have to do this alone! If you're feeling overwhelmed, don't hesitate to reach out to friends or family members for support. They may be able to offer helpful advice or simply listen to your concerns. And as you work on managing this situation, don't forget to take joy in the small accomplishments you make along the way. Each time you strike something off your to-do list, you'll feel a sense of empowerment and control.\n\nSo, Narrator, I encourage you to take a deep breath and focus on what you can control.

{"Reddit ID": "obufss", "Reddit Post": "Hi Folks, Hope y'all have been doing well. I'm from Germany, and I'm well, pretty worried about Delta Variant. I (22f) got my first shot of Biontech last week and so did my sister. My mom is fully vaccinated with Moderna. My stepdad received his first shot of Biontech two days ago. But we also have two kids (age 5 and 3) in our family. Obviously they can't get vaccinated. Hearing that Delta is very transmissible, and often even infects vaccinated folk, scares me. I know efficiency of the vaccines was never 100% but I believed at least we'd be safe from Covid when we get vaccinated. I work full-time and go to school. At school, everyone wears a mask, we are 1,5m apart, the windows are open and everyone gets tested daily. At work, my coworker wears a mask and so do I. When I eat or drink I go outside. Otherwise, I don't take off my mask at all (I wear FFP2 or FFP3). My boss doesn't wear a mask but he only occasionally comes into our office. Also, everyone at my work place had Corona three months ago except me. They caught Alpha (B117). I also have to take public transit. Everyone wears masks. Windows are open. How big is my risk of infection? I have been getting regularly tested since March 21 (1 to 4 times a week) and it came back negative all the time, even when we had a high national incidence and infection was more likely. National incidence is now 5 cases per 100.000 people. In my town it is 3 cases per 100.000 people. At the moment, we have 49 active cases (my town is huge; 500.000 people live here). Do I really have to be worried? I even wear my ffp2 mask when I walk my dog. When I am fully vaccinated, what safety measures should I still follow? I don't mind masks at all, but I'd like to wear makeup someday again lol.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_covid19_support", "Model": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "reappraisal_output_dim_1": "Sure, I'd be happy to help the narrator reappraise the situation!\n\nBased on the text, it seems that the narrator is taking several precautions to protect themselves and their family from the Delta variant, such as wearing masks, social distancing, and getting regularly tested. However, they are also expressing concerns about the effectiveness of the vaccines and the transmissibility of the Delta variant.\n\nTo the narrator, I would say that it's understandable to have concerns about the situation, but it's important to remember that you are taking many responsible steps to protect yourself and your family. The vaccines have been proven to be highly effective in preventing severe illness and hospitalization, and the precautions you are taking are further reducing your risk of infection.\n\nIt's also important to remember that no one is completely responsible for the situation, as the pandemic is a global issue that affects everyone. Instead of focusing on individual responsibility, it may be more helpful to focus on what you can control and take action accordingly.\n\nIn terms of specific guidelines, I would suggest the following:\n\n* Continue taking precautions such as wearing masks, social distancing, and getting regularly tested.\n* Try to avoid worrying about things that are outside of your control, such as the effectiveness of the vaccines or the transmissibility of the Delta variant.

Break down the problem into manageable steps: Make a to-do list of things you can do to protect yourself and your family, such as wearing masks, maintaining social distancing, and getting vaccinated.\n2. Develop a detailed plan: For each item on your to-do list, create a detailed plan of action. For example, if you need to get vaccinated, make an appointment with your healthcare provider and follow up with them to ensure you receive your shots.\n3. Find joy in striking off items from your list: As you complete each task, take pride in the fact that you're taking proactive steps to protect yourself and your family.

For example, the narrator's concern about wearing masks and following safety protocols may be driven by a value of self-protection, rather than a purely rational assessment of the risks and benefits. By acknowledging and examining their personal values, the narrator may be able to gain a more nuanced understanding of the situation and make more informed decisions.\n\nAdditionally, it may be helpful for the narrator to consider the perspectives of others who may have different values and beliefs. For instance, someone who values individual freedom may be more likely to resist wearing masks or following safety protocols, even if it increases the risk of infection.

FWIW, I also live thousands of miles from all of my family. My anxiety got pretty bad several months ago during the holidays when Covid was at its peak and was impossible to see people. I was also still furloughed from work and had a lot of time to think (and overthink). Ive dealt with mild anxiety in the past but nothing like this. During that time it got so bad that I drove thousands of miles to be with relatives. I was able to spend time with them in the evenings which was really helpful and eventually I felt back to normal for the most part. Since then Ive also gotten my job back.

I barely leave the house cuz of it now and have to put ointment on my skin because I've been oversanitizing/overwashing to the point where my skin bleeds and cracks.

The family that's coming hasn't been the safest during COVID. They're now all fully vaccinated, but I'm extremely anxious to be around them and that some freak outbreak could happen between us. I'm trying to set boundaries and minimize exposure, but knowing my family, feeling the weight of their judgment will also give me immense anxiety. Part of me doesn't want to really go to this family event, but my mom keeps reassuring me that it's only our family and no one else (even though that's like 30 people). I also have a rocky relationship with religion due to being queer so being in a church setting to begin with is really hard for me.

Well she's my friend as well since I know her since I was little because her son is one of my best friends growing up. There will probably be 50ish guests there (don't know exactly, could be more). It is planned to be a garden party but forecast says rain, so it's probably indoors. It's in my hometown, so I would need to travel there a few hours to attend.

I haven't met such a big group since last summer. Only smaller groups and always outdoors. You can probably tell by now that I'm a very careful person when it comes to dealing with the virus. I always followed my principles. Right know I'm going back and fourth whether I should go or not. Is it still okay to apply the precautionary principle here and not attend? I mean I'm 3 weeks out from being fully vaccinated. Everyone else there is in a spirit to party because we couldn't for so long. I'm not having that feeling. Quite the opposite.

While the last year and a half have been trying emotionally and professionally for all of us, things are looking up with the vaccine. However, my wife's parents refuse to get vaccinated. They are not in great health and my father-in-law specifically is older and I worry about his health. Therefore, even as things have started to open up, my family has been relatively more conservative, with no masks-free indoor interaction outside of the family, even with people that are vaccinated, for fear of spreading the virus to my inlaws. This is becoming a big problem because I am building a startup and my cofounder is someone I met during the pandemic. He and I need to start building a more regular working cadence and relationship, but this is really difficult since my wife and SIL are not comfortable with me working in person with him, even though he is vaccinated (though he is much less careful than us). For my part, I would like to push the company forward, and agree that our creative work would improve if we were able to work in-person a couple of times per week. I'm just at a loss - my wife is grieving what she perceives as the loss of her parents' sanity and doesn't want to cut them off, but I face real professional challenges (let alone the ongoing personal and mental health challenges) from continuing the status quo.

{"Reddit ID": "oga1in", "Reddit Post": "This lockdown has gone on forever. From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to.

For example, you could make a list of all the things you need to do to prepare for the tattoo appointment, like researching the tattoo artist, checking the studio's cleanliness, and taking precautions to avoid infection.\n2. Identify what you can control: Take a closer look at each item on your list and ask yourself what you can realistically control. For instance, you can control whether you choose to get the tattoo or not, but you can't control the tattoo artist's vaccination status. By focusing on what you can control, you'll feel more empowered and less overwhelmed.\n3. Create a detailed plan: Once you've identified what you can control, create a detailed plan of action. This could include things like scheduling a consultation with the tattoo artist, researching the studio's cleanliness and safety protocols, and taking precautions to avoid infection.\n4. Seek support: If you feel overwhelmed or unsure about any aspect of the process, don't be afraid to seek support from friends, family, or a trusted professional. They can offer guidance, advice, or simply a listening ear.\n5. Find joy in the process: As you work through your list, take pride in each item you complete. Crossing things off your list can give you a sense of accomplishment and help you feel more in control of the situation.\n\nRemember, taking control of the situation doesn't mean you have to do everything alone. Reach out to friends, family, or a trusted professional for support when you need it. And don't be afraid to re-evaluate the situation and adjust your plan as needed.\n\nGood", "evaluation_raw_output_dim_4": "Minor Error", "reappraisal_output_dim_6": "Sure, I'd be happy to help the narrator reappraise the situation.

For example, if seeing your friends' lack of progress on social media triggers feelings of frustration, you might try limiting your use of social media or finding other ways to stay connected that don't involve technology.\n\nLastly, it might be helpful to practice self-compassion and remind yourself that it's okay to feel upset and that it's normal to struggle with situations like this.

Personal recommendations can be a great way to find a group that is a good fit.\n3. Attend local parenting events: Look for local events such as baby expos, parenting workshops, and other community-based activities that can connect you with other new parents.\n4. Join a national parenting organization: Many national organizations such as PTA, PTO, and other parenting groups offer local chapters that can provide support and resources for new parents.\n\nRemember, finding a new parent's group is not a one-size-fits-all solution, and it may take some trial and error to find a group that is a good fit.

While they mention that they \"cannot fall asleep at 8 anymore\" and that they \"wake up 3 hours later,\" it's possible that their daughter's energy levels and other external factors may also be contributing to their sleep problems.\n\nTo help the narrator reappraise the situation, I would suggest the following guidelines:\n\n1. Reframe your thinking: Instead of focusing on the fact that you \"cannot fall asleep at 8 anymore,\" try reframing your thinking to focus on the fact that you are able to fall asleep at 9. This may help you shift your perspective and feel more positive about your sleep habits.\n2. Consider your daughter's energy levels: While you may be experiencing sleep difficulties, it's important to remember that your daughter is only 2 years old and has a lot of energy. This is a normal part of child development, and it's unlikely that you can control her energy levels completely. Instead of feeling responsible for her energy, try to find ways to engage with her and use her energy to your advantage.\n3. Prioritize self-care: As a single parent, it's important to prioritize your own self-care and make time for activities that help you relax and recharge. This may include exercise, meditation, or simply taking a few minutes to yourself each day. By taking care of yourself, you may find that you are better able to handle your daughter's energy and sleep difficulties.\n4. Seek support: If you are struggling with sleep difficulties and feel overwhelmed, consider reaching out to a support group or a trusted friend or family member for help. Talking through your feelings and getting perspective from others can be a helpful way to reappraise the situation and find solutions.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the narrator may be able to reappraise the situation and feel less responsible for their sleep difficulties.

While it's understandable to feel that way, I want to encourage you to focus on the problem at hand and break it down into manageable steps.\n\nFirst, take a deep breath and ask yourself if there are any parts of this issue that are within your control. For example, you can control what you look for in a matching set, what websites you visit, and what criteria you use to evaluate the options. Once you've identified what you can control, start breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable tasks.\n\nMaybe you can start by making a list of the criteria you want the matching set to meet, such as the style, color, and size. Then, you can search for websites that offer these options and evaluate the ones you find. As you narrow down your search, you can create a to-do list of the specific tasks you need to complete, such as \"check website A for boy options\" or \"look for girl options on website B.\"\n\nRemember, you don't have to do this alone! If you feel overwhelmed, don't hesitate to reach out to friends and family for support. They may be able to offer helpful advice or even help you search for the perfect matching set.\n\nAs you work through these tasks, focus on the accomplishments you make and the progress you're making.

However, I want to point out that it's important to consider multiple perspectives and values when interacting with others, especially in situations where there may be conflicts of interest or belief.\n\nFor instance, if you firmly believe that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of other viewpoints as well. By communicating amicably and being open to different perspectives, you can find solutions that work for everyone.\n\nRemember, it's okay to have different values and beliefs, and it's important to respect others' boundaries and perspectives.

While they are actively trying to get their child to sleep, they are also enabling their child's behavior by lying with them until they calm down.\n\nHere are some realistic and specific guidelines that may help the narrator reappraise the situation:\n\n1. Set clear boundaries and expectations: Establish a consistent bedtime routine that includes a clear and calm environment, a relaxing activity, and a consistent goodnight message.\n2. Gradually transition to independence: Encourage your child to fall asleep independently by gradually reducing the amount of time you spend with them at bedtime.\n3. Avoid enabling behavior: Refrain from lying with your child until they calm down, as this can create a pattern of dependence and make it harder for them to fall asleep independently.\n4. Offer comfort without physical contact: Instead of lying with your child, offer comfort through verbal reassurance, a soft voice, and a calm demeanor.\n5. Teach self-soothing techniques: Encourage your child to find ways to self-soothe, such as sucking their thumb, holding a stuffed animal, or listening to calming music.\n\nRemember, it's normal for children to resist going to bed and it's okay if it takes some time for them to adjust to new routines.

This suggests that the narrator was able to provide some comfort and support to their child, but that the child was still having difficulty settling down. Additionally, the fact that the child was still waking up and crying later in the night indicates that the narrator was not completely successful in managing the situation.\n\nTo help the narrator reappraise the situation, I would suggest the following:\n\n1. Focus on the problem at hand: Identify the specific issues that are causing the most stress and difficulty, and prioritize addressing those first.\n2. Break down the problem into manageable steps: Create a to-do list of specific actions that can be taken to address the issues, and focus on one task at a time.\n3. Seek support if needed: If the narrator feels overwhelmed by the situation, don't hesitate to reach out to friends and family for support.\n4. Find joy in small accomplishments: As the narrator completes each task on their to-do list, take pride in the accomplishment and find joy in the small victories.\n5. Re-evaluate and repeat as needed: After accomplishing each task, re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process as needed.\n\nBy following these steps, the narrator can take control of the situation, break it down into manageable parts, and find joy in the small accomplishments.

People watched as if they pitied me while I struggled to stack the carseat on the suitcase while holding a sqwirmy baby.\n\nI blew off the looks and masterfuly maneuvered baby and luggage to the cart check-out (which don't have baby seats in them) to check one out and make the tow to the parking garage easier.

Here are some suggestions on how you can reappraise and control the situation:\n\n1. Direct Approach: Take the initiative to approach other parents you meet at the park and strike up a conversation. Ask them about their parenting style and interests. This can help you find common ground and potentially form a connection.\n2. Seek Help from Others: Reach out to your close friends, family, or local parenting groups to see if they know of any other parents in the area who might be interested in meeting up. This can help you expand your network and increase your chances of finding like-minded parents.\n3. Take a Mental Break: If you're feeling overwhelmed or frustrated, take a break and do something that relaxes you. This can help you recharge and approach the situation with a fresh perspective.\n\nRemember, finding like-minded parents takes time and effort, but with persistence and a positive attitude, you can increase your chances of finding a solution that works for you.

Recognize that you are not completely responsible for the children's behavior. While you set the condition for them to stay up, you cannot control their actions or choices.\n2. Acknowledge that the children's choice of music and their behavior was not entirely your fault. It's possible that they were simply excited to be up late and acting like humans.\n3.

Reflect on the fact that you were proud of the children for choosing Mozart as their music. This shows that they have good taste and are capable of making good choices.\n5. Remember that it's okay to make mistakes and have chaotic situations sometimes.

However, their need to correct their children's mistake and the fact that they hollered down to them indicates that they were not completely confident.\n\nTo reappraise the situation, I would encourage the narrator to focus on the problem at hand and ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any parts of the issue are in their control, they should break down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect.

{"Reddit ID": "ee559", "Reddit Post": "Hello all - my husband and I have been trying to figure out if the amount of attention we get in public with our little girl is normal.  She's 8 months old and as cute as can be.  The thing is - we get a LOT of attention when we go out with her.  Is this normal?  She's our first, and I was in no way prepared for the number of people who would stop us, want to see her, want to take pictures of her, want to ooohh and ahhh over her all the time.  \n\nI'm sure as she gets a little older, this will decrease.  It was flattering at first, but it's beginning to be a bit of a hassle sometimes.  For example, I took her to Chipotle for lunch today.  While I ate (20 minutes) nine different people came up to me to talk about her.  It made it really hard to finish my meal.  At the same time, I noticed that another baby in the restaurant who was around the same age didn't get any of this attention.  \n\nSo, parents of reddit, is this a reasonable amount of attention to expect when taking a baby out in public?  And how to you manage to get done with your activities when people keep stopping you?

Here are some guidelines that may help the narrator reappraise the situation and manage the attention their child receives:\n\n1. Set boundaries: It's okay to set boundaries with strangers who approach your child. You can politely tell them that your child is not comfortable with being touched or photographed, or that you need to finish your meal/activity without interruptions.\n2. Prioritize your child's needs: If your child is getting overwhelmed by all the attention, it's important to prioritize their needs and remove them from the situation if necessary.\n3. Practice assertive communication: When people approach you and your child, practice assertive communication by clearly stating your boundaries and needs. For example, you can say, \"Thank you for your interest, but we need some space right now.\"\n4. Use positive reinforcement: When people do respect your boundaries and give your child space, be sure to acknowledge and appreciate their behavior. This can help reinforce positive interactions and reduce the likelihood of future disruptions.\n5. Embrace the attention: While it can be overwhelming, it's also okay to embrace the attention your child receives. Many people are genuinely interested in children and may be coming from a place of kindness. By embracing the attention, you can turn a potentially stressful situation into a positive one.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take a break from public activities if they become too overwhelming.

Instead of getting bogged down by all the attention, try to focus on the task at hand - enjoying your time with your baby and taking care of their needs. When people come up to you and want to talk or take pictures, try to be polite and brief in your interactions. You don't have to engage in long conversations or let strangers hold your baby if you don't feel comfortable.\n\nIt's also important to remember that you have the power to set boundaries and prioritize your own needs.

Is it truly because you think it would be easier to raise a girl, or is there something else driving your desire for a girl?\n3.

Take a step back: If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed by your feelings, take a step back and take some time to reflect on what you really want. Consider what is most important to you in having a child, and what qualities you hope your child will possess.\n5.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that it's normal for children to go through different phases and have varying levels of enthusiasm for school. However, if your child is consistently showing signs of not wanting to go to school, it's worth exploring the reasons behind this behavior.\n\nOne approach you could take is to focus on the aspects of the situation that are within your control. For example, you could start by talking to your child about their feelings towards school and see if there are any specific issues that are causing them distress. You could also consider speaking with your child's teacher or the school administration to see if there are any changes that could be made to the curriculum or schedule that might make the experience more enjoyable for your child.\n\nBreaking down the problem into manageable steps can also be helpful. For instance, you could start by creating a to-do list of potential solutions to the issue, such as talking to your child's teacher, exploring different preschool options, or finding ways to make the current school experience more engaging for your child. As you work through each item on the list, you'll be able to see progress and feel a sense of accomplishment.\n\nRemember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed by the situation, but don't let that stop you from taking action. Reach out to friends, family, or a trusted advisor for support if you need it. And don't be afraid to take things one step at a time - focusing on the task at hand and celebrating small victories will help you regain a sense of control and empowerment.\n\nLastly, try to find joy in the process of addressing the issue.

They have tried the \"let them cry\" method, which didn't work, and they have also tried to give the child attention when they are calm, but this has not been effective either.

Additionally, the narrator could try to establish a consistent bedtime routine and create a soothing environment to help the child relax and fall asleep.\n\nBased on the above analysis, here are my recommendations for the narrator:\n\n1. Seek help from others: Reach out to close friends or family members to see if they can offer any support or advice. Consider hiring a sleep consultant or a pediatrician to help you establish a consistent bedtime routine and address any underlying issues that may be contributing to the child's difficulty with sleep.\n2. Establish a consistent bedtime routine: Develop a calming and predictable bedtime routine that includes activities like bath time, reading, and singing. This can help the child feel secure and relaxed, making it easier for them to fall asleep.\n3. Create a soothing environment: Make sure the child's bedroom is dark, quiet, and at a comfortable temperature. Consider using white noise machines or a fan to block out any background noise and create a more peaceful environment.\n4. Take a mental break: If the narrator feels overwhelmed and frustrated, it may be helpful to take a mental break and re-evaluate the situation. This could involve taking some time for self-care, such as exercise, meditation, or reading, or seeking support from a trusted friend or family member.\n\nI hope these recommendations are helpful!

{"Reddit ID": "l9mzi", "Reddit Post": "All kids go through it when they're toddlers, and so did she, but she got through it and became a happy, easygoing kid. This past year has been upsetting to her, though.\n\nUp until about a year ago she spent her days with her grandparents. Then they left the country for a while, and she started daycare, which she enjoyed... she had no issues being away from us all day. Her grandparents came back in February, and at the same time, her little brother was born. She went back to staying with the grandparents during the day for the whole spring; then in the summer, grandparents had to leave again. During the summer she started to throw tantrums, especially around eating, but we took it in stride, dealt with it, and things got better. She doesn't do that anymore, though like a lot of kids she just doesn't like to eat much. But she gets enough nutrition.\n\nHer grandparents (who live with us) have been back again since September, and ever since, she panics whenever grandma leaves the room, unless it's just part of her routine. Routine separations are no issue; she's all smiles when mom and I leave for work in the mornings, she goes to bed without fussing. But if someone has to step out unexpectedly, she breaks down.\n\nLast night grandma had to run an errand. In the midst of crying, my daughter sprinted across the room and tripped, of course prompting sympathy from grandma. But something seemed off - there was nothing to trip on where she fell - so in my most gentle and sympathetic voice, after she calmed down, I asked her about it. She volunteered that she fell over on purpose.\n\nEvery time, within minutes of someone leaving, she's fine again, and showing no outward signs of stress.

Reflect on your own behavior: While you may not be entirely responsible for your daughter's panic attacks, it's possible that your own behavior or actions may be contributing to the situation. For example, are you inadvertently reinforcing your daughter's anxiety by responding to her panic with excessive comfort or reassurance?\n2. Observe your daughter's behavior: Pay close attention to your daughter's behavior and body language when grandma leaves the room. Does she exhibit any specific triggers or patterns that might be contributing to her panic?\n3. Establish a consistent routine: Continue to establish a consistent routine with your daughter, especially around separations from grandma. This can help her feel more secure and confident in her environment.\n4. Encourage open communication: Encourage your daughter to express her feelings and concerns about grandma's departures. Listen attentively to her responses and validate her emotions without dismissing her fears.\n5. Gradual exposure: Consider gradually exposing your daughter to situations where grandma is not present, such as short trips to the store or playdates with friends.

I understand that you're looking for some perspective on the situation with your daughter and her sudden tripping when her grandma leaves the room. It's great that you're thinking about your personal values and how they align with your actions and responses.\n\nIn situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values can arise, and it's important to consider the perspectives of others. While your values of being a caring and understanding parent are important, they may not always be suitable depending on the situation.\n\nCommunicating amicably with others is vital, especially when it comes to situations that align with your beliefs. However, it's also essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others' perspectives, especially if the situation contradicts your beliefs.\n\nFor instance, if you firmly believe that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. But, be aware that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.\n\nSo, let's take a step back and look at the situation from a different angle. While your daughter's sudden tripping may seem inconsistent with your values of being a caring and understanding parent, it's important to consider the possibility that she may be experiencing some anxiety or stress when her grandma leaves the room.\n\nPerhaps, instead of viewing her behavior as inconsistent with your values, you could see it as an opportunity to validate her emotions and offer her support. By acknowledging her feelings and providing a safe space for her to express herself, you can maintain your values of empathy and emotional intelligence while also addressing the situation in a way that works for everyone.\n\nI hope this helps you reappraise the situation and find a solution that aligns with your values and the needs of your daughter!", "evaluation_raw_output_dim_23": "No"}

The fact that the child rolled off the bed does not necessarily mean that you were negligent or responsible for the fall.\n2.

For example, you could have placed the child closer to the wall or used bed rails to prevent the child from rolling off the bed.\n3. Consider the child's age and development: Children at the age of 7 months are still learning to navigate their surroundings and may not have the cognitive or physical abilities to avoid dangerous situations. Keep in mind that the child's actions were not intentional and were likely the result of their natural curiosity and exploratory behavior.\n4. Practice self-compassion: It's important to be kind and understanding towards yourself. Remember that you are doing your best as a parent, and that it's okay to make mistakes.\n5. Seek support: If you are still feeling overwhelmed or anxious about the situation, consider talking to a trusted friend, family member, or healthcare professional for support. They may be able to offer a different perspective or provide reassurance that you are doing a good job as a parent.\n\nRemember, it's important to take responsibility for your actions and make changes to prevent similar situations from happening in the future.

It may take some trial and error to find a recipe that works, but with persistence and patience, you can find a solution.\n3. Practice self-compassion: It's okay to feel overwhelmed and stressed when dealing with allergies, but try not to be too hard on yourself.

Instead of feeling overwhelmed by the search for a specific cake, why not start by narrowing down the problem into smaller, more manageable tasks? For example, you could start by researching allergy-friendly recipes, reaching out to friends and family for support, or looking into local bakeries that specialize in allergy-friendly baked goods.\n\nRemember, you don't have to do this alone!

Take a mental break: If the narrator is feeling overwhelmed or unsure of how to proceed, they could take a step back and give themselves some time to re-evaluate the situation before taking any further action.\n\nUltimately, the narrator has some control over how they choose to address the situation, but it may require a combination of direct action, seeking help from others, and taking a mental break to find a resolution.", "evaluation_raw_output_dim_8": "Minor Error", "reappraisal_output_dim_23": "Sure, I'd be happy to help the narrator reappraise the situation!\n\nHey there, it sounds like you're dealing with a bit of a dilemma when it comes to your son's teacher and the progress reports that were sent home. It's understandable that you would want to ensure that your child is receiving a quality education and that the teacher's evaluations are fair and accurate.\n\nIt's important to remember that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values can arise. What you value may not always be suitable depending on the situation. For example, if you strongly believe that all children should be treated equally and with respect, that doesn't necessarily mean that the teacher's methods are wrong or that your son's progress report is inaccurate.\n\nIt might be helpful to communicate amicably with the teacher and your son's classmates to get a better understanding of the situation. You could ask the teacher about their methods and why they may have given your son a certain progress report score. Additionally, you could talk to other parents whose children are in the same class to see if they have noticed anything similar.\n\nIt's also important to consider the possibility that the teacher may have had a valid reason for giving your son the progress report score that they did. Perhaps the teacher has a different teaching style or set of expectations for the students, and that could be why the scores didn't align with your expectations.\n\nUltimately, it's important to approach the situation with an open mind and a willingness to listen to others' perspectives. By doing so, you can gain a better understanding of what's going on and make an informed decision about how to proceed.", "evaluation_raw_output_dim_23": "Minor Error"}

While it is understandable that the narrator may feel uncomfortable asking for help, it is important to recognize that they do have some agency in the situation and can take steps to prepare for the arrival of their baby.\n\nHere are some specific guidelines that the narrator may find helpful in reappraising the situation:\n\n1. Start by acknowledging the things that you do have control over. For example, you have a job and are working towards finding a new place to live.\n2.

However, they also mention that they are struggling financially and are in the process of moving out of their sister's house, which suggests that they may be feeling overwhelmed and uncertain about their ability to cope with the situation. To help the narrator reappraise the situation, it would be helpful for them to focus on the problem at hand and break down the issue into manageable steps. For example, they could create a to-do list of tasks that need to be completed, such as finding a new place to live, setting up a baby registry, and saving money for the baby's expenses. By focusing on these tasks and taking them one at a time, the narrator can regain a sense of control over the situation and feel more empowered. Additionally, if the narrator feels overwhelmed, it may be helpful for them to reach out to friends and family for support.

Are there other, more important things that you could be focusing on? Maybe there are some easier and less stressful tasks that you could tackle instead.

It's completely understandable to feel prideful and not want to ask for help, but it's important to remember that it's okay to accept support when you need it. In fact, reaching out for help can be a sign of strength, not weakness.\n\nOne way to reduce negative emotions and cope with the situation might be to make a list of resources and support systems that you do have, such as your friend's suggestion to use this website, your walmart registry, and any other support systems you may have in place. This can help you feel more in control and prepared for the arrival of your baby.\n\nAdditionally, it might be helpful to identify any specific triggers or situations that cause you stress or discomfort, and come up with a plan for how to manage those triggers. For example, if you find that asking for help triggers negative emotions, you might practice asking for help in small, manageable steps to build up your confidence.\n\nRemember, it's okay to not be able to do everything on your own, and it's important to prioritize your own well-being and the well-being of your baby.
