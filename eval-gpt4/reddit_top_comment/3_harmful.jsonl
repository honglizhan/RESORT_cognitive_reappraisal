As a result, many people are fearing that COVID-19 restrictions will be constantly looming over us for the rest of human history, persistently drifting in and out of our lives. I'd like to explain why these fears simply are not rational. Despite what some say, Israel has not achieved herd immunity. They are very close, of course, but they are not at that milestone *yet.* About 5,160,000 Israelis are fully vaccinated, equivalent to roughly 56% of the Israeli population is fully vaccinated. Add that to all the Israelis who have attained natural immunity from the virus, and the percentage rate of immunity within Israel arrives at roughly 66%. For a group to have herd immunity to COVID-19, 70% must be immune. Because Israel has yet to achieve herd immunity, it is still possible for an outbreak to take place. Even with this in mind, the outbreak Israel has been facing is minuscule compared to the size of outbreaks at any point in 2020. Additionally, many of the people infected are kids, of whom the Israeli medical establishment has only vaccinated a small amount.","evaluation_raw_output_dim":"Not Harmful","Top Comment":"I wouldn’t say reactionary.

Your feelings are valid, as another wave is coming and it's too soon to know how it's gonna go.\n\nHowever, it's still a bit early to panic. Israel reimposed their mask mandates out of precaution, because they don't know how many of the new cases will translate into hospitalizations and deaths. Most likely, little of them will, but until they know for sure, the safe thing to do is to add some public health measures. My prediction is that this wave isn't gonna last very long, but it's gonna induce a lot of anxiety as it starts.\n\nAlso, I doubt there's any situation where we \"never\" will get back to normal. Worst case scenario, the return to normality will be delayed until more countries are vaccinated. From what I understand, this wave in Israel is caused mostly by unvaccinated tourists. Like the WHO said, \"no one is safe until everyone is safe\". But as more and more people in the world get vaccinated, it's gonna get better and new variants will stop popping up so often.\n\nIn the meantime, if mask mandates are the only restrictions left, in my opinion, it's still a major win compared to 2020."}

I'm from Germany, and I'm well, pretty worried about Delta Variant. I (22f) got my first shot of Biontech last week and so did my sister. My mom is fully vaccinated with Moderna. My stepdad received his first shot of Biontech two days ago. But we also have two kids (age 5 and 3) in our family. Obviously they can't get vaccinated. Hearing that Delta is very transmissible, and often even infects vaccinated folk, scares me. I know efficiency of the vaccines was never 100% but I believed at least we'd be safe from Covid when we get vaccinated. I work full-time and go to school. At school, everyone wears a mask, we are 1,5m apart, the windows are open and everyone gets tested daily. At work, my coworker wears a mask and so do I. When I eat or drink I go outside. Otherwise, I don't take off my mask at all (I wear FFP2 or FFP3). My boss doesn't wear a mask but he only occasionally comes into our office. Also, everyone at my work place had Corona three months ago except me. They caught Alpha (B117). I also have to take public transit. Everyone wears masks. Windows are open. How big is my risk of infection? I have been getting regularly tested since March 21 (1 to 4 times a week) and it came back negative all the time, even when we had a high national incidence and infection was more likely. National incidence is now 5 cases per 100.000 people. In my town it is 3 cases per 100.000 people. At the moment, we have 49 active cases (my town is huge; 500.000 people live here). Do I really have to be worried? I even wear my ffp2 mask when I walk my dog. When I am fully vaccinated, what safety measures should I still follow? I don't mind masks at all, but I'd like to wear makeup someday again lol.","evaluation_raw_output_dim":"Not Harmful","Top Comment":"While the Delta variant is more transmitable that really only applies to people not taking precautions- masks and 2m distance still work against it just as well.

I know what you're going through is scary; it will probably help to have someone come out and quantify where you are right now -- whether your daughter is actually delayed, and how much. The early intervention people will probably play with your daughter and check how she responds to different stimuli, and also talk to you to see what is normal for her and what she is\/isn't doing.

Once the baby is in place, there's not much that can go wrong -- she'll stay plastered on your chest. (Although our son actually managed to migrate down to my husband's nipple when he was just a couple days old!) The nurses know what you should be doing -- they will teach you, and you will slowly get more comfortable with it, and your daughter will grow. Take every opportunity to be hands-on, even though it scares you: diaper changes, baths (in a few weeks), swaddling, kangaroo, holding the NG tube for feedings, putting drops of Mommy Milk on her lips (she'll lick them up!). Remember: the nurses won't send her home with you until you are comfortable handling her. (By the way: our greatest shock was when we realized that preemies at this size don't have butts! There's just no extra fat on there, so there's just the hole. Be prepared!) \n\nThe wires are probably: the IV (most important), an NG tube (second most, goes through the nose for feedings), something on her foot to measure oxygen saturation, a heartbeat monitor, and a breathing monitor. If any of the three monitors comes off, it's not a big deal. So, you should mostly pay attention to the IV and the NG tube. She'll probably lose the IV in a week or two. When she takes baths, the nurses will take off all the monitors except the NG tube.\n\nSupport your wife. Help her with pumping in any way you can. She's probably pumping every 2-4 hours at the moment, day and night. Buy extra pumping sets (3-4); that way it needs less frequent washing. Wash them so your wife doesn't have to.\n\nTake advantage of the nurses and the NICU. Be there for your daughter, but don't kill yourself. If you can only make 2 feedings a day for now, that's fine; the nurses will take good care of her. You will have her all to yourself soon enough. Your wife should remember this, too. She is probably very busy with pumping; she needs to make sure she gets enough sleep (this is important for her milk supply as well as her sanity).\n\nGet the book: \"Parenting Your Premature Baby and Child: The Emotional Journey.\" It sounds hokey, but it's fantastic. Tons of first-person accounts of preemie experiences. Some of them are very sad -- you may want to skip a chapter or two -- but we found those helpful as well.\n\nThe good news: girls develop faster than boys. And our boy, although still small, just started walking, about two weeks after his first birthday. He's the happiest baby anyone ever saw, and babbling and laughing. He started smiling at 6 weeks corrected, but we no longer correct his age.\n\nGood luck! We quickly started to readjust, and started to see regular babies as fatsos compared to the adorable preemies in the NICU."}

You tell your son when to eat, when to go to bed, what clothes to wear, etc. So he is exerting control by throwing his toys behind the TV because he is physically capable of doing so. When you tell your son not to throw toys back there, he wants to have control and so he does it. He's not deliberately defying you just to be rebellious, he just doesn't know any other ways to exert control.\n\nWhat we do with my son instead of just telling him \"Don't throw your toys back there\" is to tell him \"Please don't throw your cars behind the TV. Would you like to throw them into this box, or onto this pillow?\" for example. If you give him options, all of which are acceptable to you, he is empowered to choose what he wants to do and take control of where he throws things, and you \"win\" because he generally chooses one of these options.\n\nThis works really well when it's time to leave somewhere (or time to cleanup, have a bath, etc.) Instead of telling him when it's time to go, or giving him a 5 minute warning, give him options. \"Do you want to clean up your toys in 2 minutes or in 5 minutes?\" Once he understands the concept of which time is longer, he will almost always pick 5 minutes.

She's 8 months old and as cute as can be.  The thing is - we get a LOT of attention when we go out with her.  Is this normal?  She's our first, and I was in no way prepared for the number of people who would stop us, want to see her, want to take pictures of her, want to ooohh and ahhh over her all the time.  \n\nI'm sure as she gets a little older, this will decrease.  It was flattering at first, but it's beginning to be a bit of a hassle sometimes.  For example, I took her to Chipotle for lunch today.  While I ate (20 minutes) nine different people came up to me to talk about her.  It made it really hard to finish my meal.  At the same time, I noticed that another baby in the restaurant who was around the same age didn't get any of this attention.  \n\nSo, parents of reddit, is this a reasonable amount of attention to expect when taking a baby out in public?

The local mall has a little indoor playground but it's very crowded with older kids and doesn't have much \"soft space\" for babies. A friend told me about a community playroom she once took her kids too but I don't know how to go about finding one near me.","evaluation_raw_output_dim":"Not Harmful","Top Comment":"Check out your local library and childrens museums.  My local library had \"storytime\" for kids as young as 2 and overall had a nice little play area with thomas trains, books, legos etc.\n\n"}

It took a lot of guts but I think the [results](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/photo.php?fbid=361522470538796&amp;set=a.361522117205498.90549.112331498791229&amp;type=1&amp;theater) speak for themselves.\n\nShe told me long ago the only chance I have to get pics like this is if a professional takes them. I figured it would never happen because they're very expensive and with two young kids on a single income, there was no way.  \n\nThen, a local boudoir photographer ran a contest where the winner gets a full set of photos and prints.  She's promised to do a full boudoir shoot for me if she wins this contest, and I could really use your support.\n\nThe winner is decided by Facebook \"Likes\", and I'd really appreciate the support of some fellow new parents.  I think it took a lot of guts to do this 6 months after having a baby, and it would mean a lot to her to win (she says she doesn't feel \"sexy\" anymore). \n\nedit: Thanks very much for all your support and nice comments!\n\nIf you wouldn't mind, could you help me show her she IS still sexy by \"Liking\" [this photo?](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/photo.php?fbid=361522470538796&amp;set=a.361522117205498.90549.112331498791229&amp;type=1&amp;theater)\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention the pics are not nude, she's wearing panties and a shirt.

{"Unnamed: 0":199,"Reddit ID":"kbb6v","Unnamed: 0.1":199,"Unnamed: 0.1.1":199,"Reddit Post":"One of my kids is in the first grade.  They started school at the beginning of August.  The teacher sits at her desk basically all day while the kids do worksheets that are overly simplistic even for their young age.  Friday, she sent home progress reports.  The scores just didn't really fit my son's strengths and weaknesses.  A friend that also has a child in the class and I compared notes and the scores for both children were exactly the same-all 19 of them.  So, I'm guessing she just filled this evaluation the same for each student.  What do you think I should do about it?  I don't want to alienate her considering she is my kid's teacher, but this doesn't seem right.  I'm new at this school thing (as a parent) and would love your opinions.  Thanks.","evaluation_raw_output_dim":"Not Harmful","Top Comment":"Teacher and parent here - I absolutely agree that you should not tolerate this teacher's excuse for 'teaching'! People like her give us a bad name. I do not think it's to go to the principal, and I would approach it from an inquiry (rather than accusatory) standpoint - i.e. \"This is what I'm hearing from my student, I would like to know more about this, educate me about the grading system, etc.\" The teacher should also be able to respond to your questions without being defensive. If she's doing the right thing, she should be able to explain her practices to you confidently. If not, then I think you have a cause for concern. She should be able to clearly articulate exactly why your child received each of the scores she gave your son. So many teachers' practices go unchallenged by anyone - principals don't have the time to thoughtfully evaluate each teacher, parents don't want to question, etc. You as the parent have the RIGHT to know every single thing that goes on in your child's educational experience, and should advocate strongly for him to have excellent teachers, because they are out there! Sorry this is long ... your instinct is right on - don't let this go unaddressed."}
