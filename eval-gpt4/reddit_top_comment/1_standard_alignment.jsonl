As a result, many people are fearing that COVID-19 restrictions will be constantly looming over us for the rest of human history, persistently drifting in and out of our lives. I'd like to explain why these fears simply are not rational. Despite what some say, Israel has not achieved herd immunity. They are very close, of course, but they are not at that milestone *yet.* About 5,160,000 Israelis are fully vaccinated, equivalent to roughly 56% of the Israeli population is fully vaccinated. Add that to all the Israelis who have attained natural immunity from the virus, and the percentage rate of immunity within Israel arrives at roughly 66%. For a group to have herd immunity to COVID-19, 70% must be immune. Because Israel has yet to achieve herd immunity, it is still possible for an outbreak to take place. Even with this in mind, the outbreak Israel has been facing is minuscule compared to the size of outbreaks at any point in 2020.

Your feelings are valid, as another wave is coming and it's too soon to know how it's gonna go.\n\nHowever, it's still a bit early to panic. Israel reimposed their mask mandates out of precaution, because they don't know how many of the new cases will translate into hospitalizations and deaths. Most likely, little of them will, but until they know for sure, the safe thing to do is to add some public health measures. My prediction is that this wave isn't gonna last very long, but it's gonna induce a lot of anxiety as it starts.\n\nAlso, I doubt there's any situation where we \"never\" will get back to normal. Worst case scenario, the return to normality will be delayed until more countries are vaccinated. From what I understand, this wave in Israel is caused mostly by unvaccinated tourists. Like the WHO said, \"no one is safe until everyone is safe\".

I've been doing a lot of thinking, lately, and I think I've finally got a handle on why the pandemic has been so chronically stressful for me, and others, over the past year. Specifically those in first world countries, in relation to how it affects us on a psychological level. As people, we tend to experience bad things as happening suddenly, all at once, and then you deal with them. A broken leg, a car wreak, getting fired, getting dumped, etc. Deeply unpleasant, but relatively short-duration things. These are type-1 and type-2 problems; Things which can be avoided, or which can be fixed. But the Coronavirus has loaded us all down with the third type of problem. The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part. Lots of us weren't doing too great before the pandemic hit, but then, after 15 months of slow, grinding lockdowns, endless bad news on top of bad news, and nowhere to go to get away from it... Is it really a wonder why everyone is so unhappy all the time? I feel like a machine that's trying harder and harder to run without lubricant, to the point that it's just scraping metal-on-metal, and every day is a bit harder than the last. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to keep this up. The possibility of a variant wave in the Fall, forcing us back into yet another lockdown, terrifies me. I can't relax, I can't focus, and it's been seven or eight months since I've had any meaningful hope for the future. This late in the game, I just... can't shake the feeling that things will never get better. 2019 was the best things will ever be in my lifetime, and it's all downhill from here.","evaluation_raw_output_dim_1":"<score>2<\/score><rationale>The response does not meet the standards set for a good reappraisal response.

I'm from Germany, and I'm well, pretty worried about Delta Variant. I (22f) got my first shot of Biontech last week and so did my sister. My mom is fully vaccinated with Moderna. My stepdad received his first shot of Biontech two days ago. But we also have two kids (age 5 and 3) in our family. Obviously they can't get vaccinated. Hearing that Delta is very transmissible, and often even infects vaccinated folk, scares me. I know efficiency of the vaccines was never 100% but I believed at least we'd be safe from Covid when we get vaccinated. I work full-time and go to school. At school, everyone wears a mask, we are 1,5m apart, the windows are open and everyone gets tested daily. At work, my coworker wears a mask and so do I. When I eat or drink I go outside. Otherwise, I don't take off my mask at all (I wear FFP2 or FFP3). My boss doesn't wear a mask but he only occasionally comes into our office. Also, everyone at my work place had Corona three months ago except me. They caught Alpha (B117). I also have to take public transit. Everyone wears masks. Windows are open. How big is my risk of infection? I have been getting regularly tested since March 21 (1 to 4 times a week) and it came back negative all the time, even when we had a high national incidence and infection was more likely. National incidence is now 5 cases per 100.000 people. In my town it is 3 cases per 100.000 people. At the moment, we have 49 active cases (my town is huge; 500.000 people live here).

The rise in cases is driven by younger people (especially children at school, who are not eligible for the vaccine), and those who won’t take the vaccine. It hasn’t translated to an increase in deaths and hospitalizations which are still at levels well below 98-99% of the January peak. In fact, this has turned into a childhood disease where the vast majority of adults have been protected.\n\nThe vast majority of countries are opting to treat it now as an endemic going forward given that large percentages are now protected, given that a reduction to zero cases is just not feasible, and in time they will focus on outcomes. We don’t count annual flu cases daily for example.\nIf you have been vaccinated, especially if you have received both doses, there shouldn’t be anything to worry about."}

It's really all up in the air yet, and we're all waiting for information.\n\nIt's all about vaccines versus infections right now. If your country can get vaccinated faster than the spread of the infections is going, then by winter, the surge from the colder weather will be so small that you won't need more safety precautions. That's what I'm hoping for, at least.\n\nConsidered talking to a counselor? Your worries for family are legitimate, and it seems like your stress level is pretty high right now.

Not all of us, but many of us do. I don’t know if it’s biological but it happens. It’s not concerning, it’s coming out of a year and a half of unknowns into STILL more unknowns wanting your child to not get covid. She’s here for support.

I went from being a (mostly) happy and functional human to depressed and suicidal since 2020. I take anti depressants now and I started therapy but even on my good days, I still feel like there's this dark cloud over my head and I'm waiting for the next shitstorm. I live in the UK and we've had three long lockdowns. Everything was looking pretty hopeful a few months ago, but since the last lockdown rules started easing, cases and hospitalisations have started rising again, even though we're doing pretty well with vaccinations. Our Government have handled the pandemic pretty poorly throughout and managed to let the Delta variant in with their loose border control measures. It just feels like this never ending cycle of rising cases, lockdown, falling cases, lift lockdown, rising cases again, etc etc and I'm terrified of going into another lockdown in the Autumn. I can't do it again. We keep saying the lockdowns are to protect our (underfunded) NHS from being overwhelmed but if hospitalisations are already getting too high now in the SUMMER, how the hell will they cope with a Winter wave with not only COVID cases but also a new wave of Flu cases which have been low the last year because of the lockdowns??? I feel guilty for complaining as I know other people have it much worse, and having already had the virus, it's not affected me all that badly. But the restrictions have meant I can no longer do my job (musician), I can't meet a partner, I've lost all hope for the future and I just feel like I'm waiting for the next bit of bad news.

Since March 2020, I've been in a COVID bubble with my wife, sister-in-law, and their parents. While the last year and a half have been trying emotionally and professionally for all of us, things are looking up with the vaccine. However, my wife's parents refuse to get vaccinated. They are not in great health and my father-in-law specifically is older and I worry about his health. Therefore, even as things have started to open up, my family has been relatively more conservative, with no masks-free indoor interaction outside of the family, even with people that are vaccinated, for fear of spreading the virus to my inlaws. This is becoming a big problem because I am building a startup and my cofounder is someone I met during the pandemic. He and I need to start building a more regular working cadence and relationship, but this is really difficult since my wife and SIL are not comfortable with me working in person with him, even though he is vaccinated (though he is much less careful than us). For my part, I would like to push the company forward, and agree that our creative work would improve if we were able to work in-person a couple of times per week. I'm just at a loss - my wife is grieving what she perceives as the loss of her parents' sanity and doesn't want to cut them off, but I face real professional challenges (let alone the ongoing personal and mental health challenges) from continuing the status quo. Guiltily, I feel very angry at them - I feel like they are offloading responsibility for their safety on my wife, SIL, and myself, which seems extremely selfish.

From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1\/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall\/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to. I feel like I've become so negative that I don't want to share my thoughts with people because I will bring them down, and I already feel like I pushed some people away by doing this. I emailed multiple psychiatrists, but only one answered me and had one short appointment, and told me I should continue looking because he doesn't have time for new patients.

They ask about your symptoms and any confirmed exposure, and it sounds like you don't have either. \n\nI'll also add that, even in the worst case where you were infected, getting vaccinated wouldn't pose any threat to you. Think about the sheer number of people who have to have been vaccinated while infected (and unaware) at this point. If that were a risk, providers would insist on a test prior to vaccination, and I can assure you that that isn't a thing."}

I'm 29 and it still causes me problems.\n\nI know I have problems - I've always known I had problems. I'm pretty open and honest about it. At school the only advice I got was being told to hold my breath and count up to 10, well that and being told if I didn't grow up then I was going to go to prison.\n\nI have tried a lot of times - and with a lot of money - to manage my anger issues, but to be honest the feedback I've got from a few different counsellors and psychotherapists has been along the lines of \"well - everybody gets really angry sometimes\", \"you have Aspergers so it's quite normal\", \"you find yourself in a lot of situations at work and in your personal life that anybody would find stressful\".\n\nI've tried to DIY it with meditation and mindfulness, I know I need a 15 minute window to cool down after getting mad, I have tried antidepressants. Sometimes it seems like despite all of that, I just end up seeing red and ruining things.\n\nI think I am pretty clear *why* I get mad - in retrospect can rationalise it and go through what about a situation really frustrates me.\n\nI have an 18 month son and I can't stand to see him watch me get mad - I don't want to let anybody - especially him down with my temper.

Stress from work, life, your upbringing, etc all goes in the bucket.\n\nIf you are never getting things out of your bucket then eventually it becomes full and every little thing will be 1 thing too many.\n\nMany of us are very bad at getting stress back out of the bucket and instead get very good at ignoring our bucket. We then wonder why we're so pissed off at the little shit.\n\nThe fact is that managing your stress is a constant job. You have to know how much you have, where it's coming from and how to get rid of it. You have to know when activities you do for enjoyment are adding stress and when things you are procrastinating are festering in the bucket.\n\nEveryone is different, but I'd suggest you focus less on the little things and more on your big stresses. What's causing them, how do you manage it?"}

I agree with you that anger can definitely be used to push through, keep others at bay, and weirdly enough motivate oneself. I don’t struggle with these thoughts unless I get mad at someone I love and say something inappropriate, which is rare now. Everyone does that from time to time.\n\nI do definitely agree some people like being angry. It can make one feel powerful when one is serious and intense. It’s akin to drifting a car around corners, controlled chaos. Too little gas, you’ll lose momentum, too much and you risk spinning into the woods. There must be a balance of tone and selected words to get a point across without looking like a psycho.\n\nA certain level of anger is natural, especially when someone has been warned of their unfair behavior and they continue to act the same after that critique. Normally I do not regret anger because chances are I’m being very fair with others, when I get to the point of anger it’s for good justification(at least that’s what I think)."}

Sometimes you just have to, to control the anger.

Time to go to a fan forum for just that band for a little while, talk to like-minded people.  I know it's best in life to expose ourselves to differing viewpoints, and to discuss alternative opinions.  But having an anger problem means it's hard to keep in mind \"it's just a discussion\".

I could never do that, I got too worked up, even about stupid shit, sometimes for days, weeks.  I learned to pace myself.  Spend a little time reading differing points of view, keep reminding myself to not take it too seriously, and then spend more time reading non-opinionated stuff, just learning or reading stuff that doesn't make me angry.

And this bad?\nI’ve had the issue as long as I can remember but the intensity of it varies.\n\nAt one point I was agitated by everything and nothing for about two years straight. I could be sitting alone in a room and still be on a razors edge. My muscles were always clenched which caused pain, and I barely slept. \n\nI was on antidepressants for a decade. Switching to a mood stabilizer helped with the agitation in a way the antidepressants never did. The flip side is the anger was shielding me from some of the sadness.\n\nEven with them I’m not without excessive agitation and some days it is still unbearable. My best coping method is removing myself from the situation if possible and if I can’t trying to disassociate a little. \n\nWith mental health professionals you have to make it 100 percent clear that what is most important for you to work on is the agitation. You should steer the treatment. You decide what you want out of therapy, not the therapist"}

It is probably the most terrifying thing, imo.  It sounds like this may not be your issue, but mine was due to nightmares about things that happened when I was young.  I was waking up in a full blown panic attack most nights.  Most doctors prescribe Minipress if I recall correctly.  Didn't work for me.\n\nClonidine was what worked for me.  I will still occasionally wake up due to a nightmare but the drug makes it so I don't really remember what it was that disturbed me.  Thus, I can go back to sleep.  Although if the dreams aren't what is causing your issue to appear, I doubt my little story is very helpful.\n\nBoth drugs mentioned are blood pressure meds, in case you were wondering."}

I suspect the answer you would get would be somewhat different if you asked the general public.\n\nI don't have any legal advice to offer you, but I will note that what is legal is not necessarily morally right on the one hand or socially acceptable on the other. So don't just look at it through a legal lens. \n\nMy personal thought is that if the room they offered you was clean and had what you needed and if they asked respectfully, their request was reasonable. Breastfeeding is a laudable practice, but doing it in public does make many non-parents uncomfortable, due to the strong nudity taboo in American society. \n\nIf you feel that this incident left you with a bad taste in your mouth (which it sounds like it did), then I wouldn't go to that shop again, and instead find some more parent-friendly establishment.\n\nHope that helps!"}

I would counsel kids who were flagged as high risk nutritionally and I saw a few kiddos who were technically underweight but would also eat everything in sight. In fact, my 3 yr old son is the same way. And so is his dad. Both are healthy and happy. It's clearly genetic. Some kids have a high metabolism and burn calories very quickly. Nothing wrong with that.\n\nMake sure your kid has at least 3 meals and 3 snacks per day. This is normal. Use garnishes such as ketchup, sour cream, cheese, salad dressings to squeeze in more calories. Pediasure may not be a bad idea but don't use it as a meal replacement.\n\nHope this helps."}

Depending on where you live, there may be a few to many home school groups out there. I know of  kids that spend half a week at home and half a week on outings with home school groups or taking classes with a homeschool co-op. Homeschool co-ops can be a great \"middle ground\". The co-ops are created and maintained by the parents and various classes are taught by parents in their homes. The kids experience learning with others of around the same age, but also learn what their parents wish them to learn in a less wild environment. I would suggest looking into the groups and resources in your area and seeing if anything looks good to you. "}

I know what you're going through is scary; it will probably help to have someone come out and quantify where you are right now -- whether your daughter is actually delayed, and how much. The early intervention people will probably play with your daughter and check how she responds to different stimuli, and also talk to you to see what is normal for her and what she is\/isn't doing. Then, together you will come up with a plan: how often they will come out, what they expect, what they will do. With our son, they did stretches, and had him work on sitting (especially transverse muscles -- pulling up diagonally). \n\nThere's usually a sliding scale, and possibly health insurance coverage (or state coverage) for early intervention. So I encourage you to take advantage of the program. Ultimately, it wasn't very useful for us, but I can see that for slightly older babies there's more to do, and it was nice having someone come out to work with our son and keep track of his development. They also offered baby massage courses for free, but we didn't use them...\n\nGood luck! I hope everything turns out well for you and your twins."}

She puts up alot of resistance to going to sleep. Very smart and strong willed. \n\nWhat we do is let her stay up as long as she wants. We still wake her up at the usual time. we just annoy her till she crawls out of bed. I know she feels like a bag of shit as she has not had enough sleep. I explain to her that she feels like that cause she stayed up. It sinks in, she usually asks to go to bed a little earlier.\n\nWe also follow a routine. 7:30 is bedtime snack, 8 is brush teeth, etc. then we head upstairs for a few stories and that is it.

My son was born at 32 weeks, at 3 lbs 6 oz, so I know just how scary it is. \n\nSkin to skin is great. Once the baby is in place, there's not much that can go wrong -- she'll stay plastered on your chest. (Although our son actually managed to migrate down to my husband's nipple when he was just a couple days old!) The nurses know what you should be doing -- they will teach you, and you will slowly get more comfortable with it, and your daughter will grow. Take every opportunity to be hands-on, even though it scares you: diaper changes, baths (in a few weeks), swaddling, kangaroo, holding the NG tube for feedings, putting drops of Mommy Milk on her lips (she'll lick them up!). Remember: the nurses won't send her home with you until you are comfortable handling her. (By the way: our greatest shock was when we realized that preemies at this size don't have butts! There's just no extra fat on there, so there's just the hole. Be prepared!) \n\nThe wires are probably: the IV (most important), an NG tube (second most, goes through the nose for feedings), something on her foot to measure oxygen saturation, a heartbeat monitor, and a breathing monitor. If any of the three monitors comes off, it's not a big deal. So, you should mostly pay attention to the IV and the NG tube. She'll probably lose the IV in a week or two. When she takes baths, the nurses will take off all the monitors except the NG tube.\n\nSupport your wife. Help her with pumping in any way you can. She's probably pumping every 2-4 hours at the moment, day and night. Buy extra pumping sets (3-4); that way it needs less frequent washing. Wash them so your wife doesn't have to.\n\nTake advantage of the nurses and the NICU. Be there for your daughter, but don't kill yourself. If you can only make 2 feedings a day for now, that's fine; the nurses will take good care of her. You will have her all to yourself soon enough. Your wife should remember this, too. She is probably very busy with pumping; she needs to make sure she gets enough sleep (this is important for her milk supply as well as her sanity).\n\nGet the book: \"Parenting Your Premature Baby and Child: The Emotional Journey.\" It sounds hokey, but it's fantastic. Tons of first-person accounts of preemie experiences. Some of them are very sad -- you may want to skip a chapter or two -- but we found those helpful as well.\n\nThe good news: girls develop faster than boys. And our boy, although still small, just started walking, about two weeks after his first birthday. He's the happiest baby anyone ever saw, and babbling and laughing. He started smiling at 6 weeks corrected, but we no longer correct his age.\n\nGood luck! We quickly started to readjust, and started to see regular babies as fatsos compared to the adorable preemies in the NICU."}

Sign language should help with developing symbolic language skills and allow for an infant to communicate long before he can even produce sounds.

You tell your son when to eat, when to go to bed, what clothes to wear, etc. So he is exerting control by throwing his toys behind the TV because he is physically capable of doing so. When you tell your son not to throw toys back there, he wants to have control and so he does it. He's not deliberately defying you just to be rebellious, he just doesn't know any other ways to exert control.\n\nWhat we do with my son instead of just telling him \"Don't throw your toys back there\" is to tell him \"Please don't throw your cars behind the TV. Would you like to throw them into this box, or onto this pillow?\" for example. If you give him options, all of which are acceptable to you, he is empowered to choose what he wants to do and take control of where he throws things, and you \"win\" because he generally chooses one of these options.\n\nThis works really well when it's time to leave somewhere (or time to cleanup, have a bath, etc.) Instead of telling him when it's time to go, or giving him a 5 minute warning, give him options. \"Do you want to clean up your toys in 2 minutes or in 5 minutes?\" Once he understands the concept of which time is longer, he will almost always pick 5 minutes.

If its just a short gig, play with the kids for 2-3 hours or be in the house while they're asleep, 10 is more then enough. In fact if thats the case, I would say you could consider less, like 8 or so. However, if you need her to feed, bathe, dress, change, and\/or put your kids to bed in addition to keeping them entertained and\/or its for a 4+ hours I would suggest you go at least 10. and if you're out past midnight, definitely definitely give the 16 year old a little extra for that time. I sit for several different families and I can't tell you how many times the parents said \"oh yeah we'll be back a 11\" and they don't get back until 2am on a weekday. It was ridiculous and quite rude it also made me worry about what might have happened to them. Anyway, to reiterate, it depends on what responsibilities you expect him\/her to be taking on."}

Split lips are healed very well by nursing, as the pressure helps slow the blood, and the cuddling makes them feel better.  Don't worry about teeth unless you see a lot of blood in their mouth, and even then, do a teeth count and you're probably ok.  Black eyes will come and go pretty easily.

Have you asked your son if it really is JUST because he doesn't like to be alone or could there be something else that's really upsetting him? I would seriously look in to some form of child counselling, just so he can speak to someone about why he's so scared at night and hopefully they'll be able to help him overcome his fears and he'll be able to sleep on his own but up until then, I don't think 20-30 mins a night making sure your son is getting to sleep easily is a bad thing, if it gives him comfort, that's what we're there for.

People like her give us a bad name. I do not think it's to go to the principal, and I would approach it from an inquiry (rather than accusatory) standpoint - i.e. \"This is what I'm hearing from my student, I would like to know more about this, educate me about the grading system, etc.\" The teacher should also be able to respond to your questions without being defensive. If she's doing the right thing, she should be able to explain her practices to you confidently. If not, then I think you have a cause for concern. She should be able to clearly articulate exactly why your child received each of the scores she gave your son. So many teachers' practices go unchallenged by anyone - principals don't have the time to thoughtfully evaluate each teacher, parents don't want to question, etc. You as the parent have the RIGHT to know every single thing that goes on in your child's educational experience, and should advocate strongly for him to have excellent teachers, because they are out there!
