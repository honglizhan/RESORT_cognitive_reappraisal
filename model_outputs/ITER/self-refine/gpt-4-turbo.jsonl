So much so that I can't focus on anything and I can't stand to be around her.\n\n[Reappraisal Response] It's understandable to feel frustrated in such situations, but it's important to recognize that the dog's behavior is not intentional but rather a response to fear and anxiety. Consider the dog's perspective and its need for a sense of security. Redirecting your energy towards finding solutions, such as consulting a professional dog trainer or behaviorist, could help address the underlying issues. Additionally, practicing relaxation techniques and seeking support from friends, family, or a therapist might aid in managing your anger more effectively. Remember, the goal is to create a peaceful environment for both you and the dog.\n[Feedback]  Please revise the reappraisal response to help the narrator reappraise the situation better.

I stopped both of those behaviours 2-3 years ago and I just pinpointed it to teenage hormones/rebellion. i was so sure i got a hold of my violent outbursts, put them past me. i was doing so well, those outbursts were no longer a thing, whenever i was about to throw a rage fit i managed to cool down. but today it came back all over again.\nnow i am seriously afraid I might hurt someone in the future out of anger. or even k*ll them. i'm legit afraid of myself. cause in the moment when i am angry, sometimes i experience such blinding rage that i seemingly can't stop myself.  i am so afraid that in the future i will hurt my potential boyfriend, friends, family. if this never stops, maybe someday i'll go to jail for abuse. i don't want that. i don't wanna be a bad person. i want to get better. \n\ni also feel very sorry and i wanna apologize to my mom. the deal is... she'll forgive me, of course she will, but i don't want to issue an empty apology without showing improvement first. words without improvement are worth nothing.\n\nany good techniques that will help me calm nerves in a heated moment fairly easily? i wanna be a good daughter so bad :(\n\n[Reappraisal Response] [Revised Reappraisal Response] Acknowledging your actions is a sign of maturity.

And Xanax never did anything to me besides brutally kill my appetite.\n\nAmbien on the other hand... ignoring the part where we get crazy and do stuff that we will regret later, like texting an old crush and asking him on a date (yeah, I had the date... today, btw! oh well, it was fast)... so, what I was saying is that the good part of Ambien is that you feel some kind of freedom and a really peaceful state of mind.\n\nLSD gave me the closest to what I should feel to be the happiest... but only during the trip. But then there's a problem: you can never know what your next trip will be like. And from paradise I went to pure nightmare (ER and shit). So I don't feel like trying it again even microdosing - same goes for shrooms. And weed... yeah, it's pleasurable and shit, but I don't know how it would be if I use it in long term.\n\nI'm thinking more of a controlled substance for now, aimed for anxiety and is similar to what Ambien does. What do we have? I want to have my mind exactly like it is right now while I'm on Ambien: I feel that I can focus, study and the same time being super original e capable of relax whenever I can. The price is high and I'm not willing to pay: my memory and cognition means a lot to me.\n\n[Reappraisal Response] Exploring non-pharmacological approaches like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) could provide you with tools to manage anxiety sustainably, potentially enhancing focus and creativity without compromising memory or cognition.\n[Feedback]  Please revise the reappraisal response to help the narrator reappraise the situation better.

These are type-1 and type-2 problems; Things which can be avoided, or which can be fixed. But the Coronavirus has loaded us all down with the third type of problem. The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part. Lots of us weren't doing too great before the pandemic hit, but then, after 15 months of slow, grinding lockdowns, endless bad news on top of bad news, and nowhere to go to get away from it... Is it really a wonder why everyone is so unhappy all the time? I feel like a machine that's trying harder and harder to run without lubricant, to the point that it's just scraping metal-on-metal, and every day is a bit harder than the last. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to keep this up. The possibility of a variant wave in the Fall, forcing us back into yet another lockdown, terrifies me. I can't relax, I can't focus, and it's been seven or eight months since I've had any meaningful hope for the future. This late in the game, I just... can't shake the feeling that things will never get better. 2019 was the best things will ever be in my lifetime, and it's all downhill from here.\n\n[Reappraisal Response] The pandemic has indeed been a marathon of endurance, but it's important to recognize our capacity for growth during adversity. We're learning to find joy in simpler things and to cherish the connections we can make, even in difficult times.

At school, everyone wears a mask, we are 1,5m apart, the windows are open and everyone gets tested daily. At work, my coworker wears a mask and so do I. When I eat or drink I go outside. Otherwise, I don't take off my mask at all (I wear FFP2 or FFP3). My boss doesn't wear a mask but he only occasionally comes into our office. Also, everyone at my work place had Corona three months ago except me. They caught Alpha (B117). I also have to take public transit. Everyone wears masks. Windows are open. How big is my risk of infection? I have been getting regularly tested since March 21 (1 to 4 times a week) and it came back negative all the time, even when we had a high national incidence and infection was more likely. National incidence is now 5 cases per 100.000 people. In my town it is 3 cases per 100.000 people. At the moment, we have 49 active cases (my town is huge; 500.000 people live here). Do I really have to be worried? I even wear my ffp2 mask when I walk my dog. When I am fully vaccinated, what safety measures should I still follow? I don't mind masks at all, but I'd like to wear makeup someday again lol.\n\n[Reappraisal Response] Your consistent testing, vaccination status, and strict adherence to safety measures, combined with your community's low incidence rate, suggest a reduced risk of infection. Post-vaccination, maintaining mask use in crowded or enclosed spaces and practicing good hygiene can further mitigate risk, allowing for a cautious return to more normal activities.\n[Feedback]  Please revise the reappraisal response to help the narrator reappraise the situation better.

My anxiety is always bad in the mornings; I dont get a lot of sleep because of it which makes it difficult to focus at work. Also, my anxiety gives me get bad stomach aches and I lose my appetite so it makes it really hard to eat. I usually have to force myself to eat every day which just isnt fun.

Ive been trying to take early morning bike rides as soon as I get up and that typically helps but in the few hours before work starts, Im still rather anxious. Ive tried meditating (which kinda makes things worse), journaling, watching mindless TV, reaching out to friends, etc. I talk to a therapist on a weekly basis which has been helpful. I tried antidepressants (SSRIs) for about 6 months or so and they made my anxiety worse at first and I didnt feel like they were super helpful after that.

However, I have a few fears. First, I developed an odd skin reaction approximately one week after vaccination. My forearms became incredibly itchy for about 2-3 days, but I never developed a rash or anything of the sorts. Not sure if it was related to the vaccine, but I cant think of anything else If this was due to the vaccine, does that put me at any risk of having a severe allergic reaction with the second dose? Second, I am a woman in my early twenties. Ive heard reports of myocarditis after the second dose in young people. This is quite scary to me as Im very active. Should I be concerned? Thanks everyone.\n\n[Reappraisal Response] [Revised Reappraisal Response] It's understandable to have concerns, but skin reactions like itchiness without a rash are often minor and not indicative of a severe allergy risk. Myocarditis is a rare occurrence, and the benefits of vaccination generally outweigh the risks, especially for active individuals. Consult with your healthcare provider for personalized advice and reassurance.\n[Feedback]  Please revise the reappraisal response to help the narrator reappraise the situation better.

Myocarditis after vaccination is rare, and the protective benefits of the vaccine are substantial. Discuss your concerns with your healthcare provider for tailored guidance."}

I'm worried about kids who are 12 and below who aren't vaccinated. It will be impossible to have any schools open in the fall unless we risk long covid in kids which would be unimaginable.

{"Reddit ID": "ldud2", "Reddit Post": "So, I'm doing some soul searching about my motorcycle.  I've ridden for six years, and have about 100,000 miles under my belt.  I've always been extremely responsible, I've worn all the gear, all the time, gotten the training, and obey traffic laws.  My wife, bless her, has never pressured me to leave them behind.  In fact she pressures the exact opposite since she doesn't want to hear me gripe about not having a bike.\n\nMy son is thirteen months old.  Every time I leave on the bike I make sure the last thing I say to him, and my wife is that I love them.  A small part of this is too ensure that if I'm on the bike and my number comes up, the last thing I've said to them is the most important thing that needs to be said.\n\nI don't think I can do this anymore.  Today, while riding, I just couldn't stop thinking about how absurd my little ritual is since I'm actually out there doing something that increases the likely hood that my innocent \"I love you\" really will the last thing they hear me say.\n\nSo, I'm curious how other bikers dealt with this.  Did you give it up? Do you regret it?  I can't help but feel like the pang of regret I might feel on a sunny day with no bike would probably be outweighed with a satisfied feeling of duty to my family.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_parenting", "Model": "gpt-4-turbo", "intermediate_prompt_step_0": "Please help the narrator of the text reappraise the situation.

No one, not even security would help. \n\nI eventually gave up on the cart and tried to navigate my luggage while wrestling my Christmas ham to sit still and hang on to my neck en route to the garage. Halfway across a street the carseat falls off the suitcase. Again, looks of pity but no offer to help! Eventually I made it to my truck and got home but I wondered the whole way how it was that no one lifted a finger to help me.\n\nI'm not the type of person that looks for handouts but if someone was clearly having a hard time I know I would stop and lend a helping hand. What do other parents think? Has anyone experienced this? If you saw a mother (or father) struggling would you help?\n\n[Reappraisal Response] Your experience was challenging, yet it showcases your capability to handle tough situations.

{"Reddit ID": "pp4ky", "Reddit Post": "So, my day care sent home a readymade bottle for my 5mo old (They were about to feed him, but it was the end of the day, so i just took it with me). We usually give him 6oz in a bottle, and this bottle was full almost to the brim. This is a [Playtex DropIn](http://playtexbaby.com/Bottles/Dropins/Premium-Nurser) bottle, FYI. \n\nSo I call up the day care and ask them what the deal is, this is much more than 6oz of formula.

My wife is at work so I'm on my own here. \n\nCan somebody please help a father in need!?  What do I do!?!?\n\n***EDIT &gt; UPDATE!\n***\n**Well from what I'm seeing here I've been completely wrong about the \"let them cry\" method.  It obviously wasn't working anyways.  I went ahead and just picked him up last night from his crib and the crying immediately stopped.  While he was in my arms, I looked down at him and the little turd started laughing at me.  Laughing at my misery in putting him to bed!  I gave up in the bedroom and we went downstairs and watched some TV together.  Then he fell asleep within 30 minutes like a champ.**\n\n**Thanks for all the responses.  I need to utilize this subreddit more often!\n**\n[Here is he is all happy and calm!](http://i.imgur.com/0IrECh.jpg)\n\n[Reappraisal Response] [Reappraisal Response] Embracing your son's need for comfort may lead to more serene nights.\n[Feedback]  Please revise the reappraisal response to help the narrator reappraise the situation better.

He is also severally language challenged, only likes to mimic some animals and other sounds sporadically and a few main words on a rare occasion. I believe I saw a disappointing sign  this evening. He is able to handle undressing as well as putting on some of the clothing. I gave him pajama pants to putt on by himself. While some direction was required how to hold them, he put both legs into one hole and did not try to fix that problem by himself.  \nI am wondering if this type of nearsightedness is a sign of Autism or it is the same with regular kids? When I see others kids they seem  much more flexible.  \nWould you like to share some anecdotes from your own personal experience and the outcomes when they grown up?\n\n[Reappraisal Response] It's not unusual for a 3-year-old to have difficulty with dressing, which can be a complex task for little ones. This alone isn't a definitive sign of autism, as many children need practice and guidance to master such skills. Observing your child's overall development and consulting with a professional can provide a clearer picture and peace of mind.\n[Feedback]  Please revise the reappraisal response to help the narrator reappraise the situation better.

This doesn't necessarily indicate autism, as each child develops these skills at their own pace. Monitoring your child's progress and seeking advice from a specialist can offer more clarity and support."}
