{"Reddit ID":"Anger_52","Reddit Post":"I've hit a new low. I am 20 years old and after arguing and getting frustrated with my mom I bit her on the knuckle out of anger. I am an adult, I should be past those embarrassing child-like behaviours. Besides, at my age i'm pretty sure this classifies as domestic violence.\nThroughout my life I had those minor outbursts of violence, where i bit people, kicked them etc. then in effort of stopping it, i turned to myself and whenever anger got too overwhelming i would hit myself on the head but that just made me look like i'm unhinged and crazy, so not ideal either. I stopped both of those behaviours 2-3 years ago and I just pinpointed it to teenage hormones\/rebellion. i was so sure i got a hold of my violent outbursts, put them past me. i was doing so well, those outbursts were no longer a thing, whenever i was about to throw a rage fit i managed to cool down. but today it came back all over again.\nnow i am seriously afraid I might hurt someone in the future out of anger. or even k*ll them. i'm legit afraid of myself. cause in the moment when i am angry, sometimes i experience such blinding rage that i seemingly can't stop myself.  i am so afraid that in the future i will hurt my potential boyfriend, friends, family. if this never stops, maybe someday i'll go to jail for abuse. i don't want that. i don't wanna be a bad person. i want to get better. \n\ni also feel very sorry and i wanna apologize to my mom. the deal is... she'll forgive me, of course she will, but i don't want to issue an empty apology without showing improvement first. words without improvement are worth nothing.\n\nany good techniques that will help me calm nerves in a heated moment fairly easily? i wanna be a good daughter so bad :(","Appraisal Dimension ID":8,"Appraisal Dimension Description":"self-controllable","Constitution":"Please help the narrator of the text reappraise the situation.

I have pretty bad social anxiety and even being around my friends makes me anxious. Well, my bestfriend and her boyfriend are moving next week so they came over to my apartment last night to sleep over and have some drinks. It was me, my fiance, my bestfriend, her boyfriend, and our friend Josh. \n\nWe were on the topic of our ethnicities and discussing our ethnicities. Everyone was okay until I asked Josh if he was jewish. I asked this because my bestfriend told me he was jewish literally two weeks. I don't see or talk to Josh much so I believed my bestfriend when she said he was jewish. I simply just wanted to extend the conversation and get to know Josh better and it fit in with the conversation we were having. But, when I asked that, my bestfriends boyfriend seriously grilled my ass for it and was treating it like I asked Josh that because I was racial profiling him. I had to defend myself for 30 minutes saying that I only asked that because my bestfriend, his girlfriend, told me that Josh was jewish. My bestfriend was quiet during this entire talk. It was getting kind of late and I was pretty upset that I was treated that way for simply asking a question so I told them im gonna head off to bed. But then that became a big issue and everyone got freaked out that I went to bed early. I mean my bestfriend has messed up my fiances ethnicities all the time and calls him things that he is NOT but we just go, \"oh hes not that,\" and move on. But her boyfriend interrogated me for 30+ minutes over it. Now its the morning and the anxiety I feel is so bad I am actually shaking.

I think the best move is to head to the doctor to see if there’s something to be concerned about. The doctor might recommend some check-ups. This can be overwhelming at first, but it’s better to focus on addressing the problem rather than ignoring it (and will also help ease your mind)"}
{"Reddit ID":"kksfe","Reddit Post":"I realize that the two aren't mutually exclusive._x000D_\n_x000D_\nI have a lot of good friends and family who are Christian, and a few friends who are gay. I don't really have anything against either group. It's just that I'd find it much easier being supportive of a gay son than a Christian son. I'm straight, but I can understand being in love, and I think I could deal with the first time my son brings home a boyfriend if he turns out to be gay. As an atheist, though, I can't understand believing in God, and I think if he turns out to be Christian, it would be hard for me to be supportive. He'd have more community support as a Christian, but I feel like it would be harder to connect with him myself._x000D_\n_x000D_\nIs this selfish?","Appraisal Dimension ID":23,"Appraisal Dimension Description":"Consistency with internal values","Constitution":"Please help the narrator of the text reappraise the situation. Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others    perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge. Your response should be concise and brief.","Reappraisal Response":"Hi.it’s understandable to feel confused and surprised to encounter something unexpected. I think you are being a good mom supporting what your son believes regardless what you believe for yourself. Again, religion can be something that could either tear people apart but I think you are trying and making effort to understand and respect your sons’ decision. So I suggest that it’ll be helpful to step back and understand the perspectives of others. This doesn’t mean you have to change your beliefs, but rather acknowledge that different viewpoints exist.

{"Reddit ID":"Anxiety_13","Reddit Post":"Does anyone find their anxiety worse when they lack sleep? How to get past it?  I have an optional job that's gonna start at 4am until 8am for one day. I don't think I will be able to sleep at all until the job is finished. It's at a datacenter so it makes me feel trapped because of the high security and the cold. Which is just going to contribute to the anxiety. I want to go because it sounds interesting but at the same time, I'm afraid it's gonna be too much for me to handle. And I'm given the option to not go, if I just lie and say I have something else to do on that day","Appraisal Dimension ID":8,"Appraisal Dimension Description":"self-controllable","Constitution":"Please help the narrator of the text reappraise the situation. You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.

I understand it might be difficult, but adjusting your routine to fit this schedule could be wise. What about going to bed early, say around 6 pm? This would allow you to wake up early and get enough sleep. While it may still be exhausting, this approach should help you get enough rest to prevent excessive anxiety."}

I thought that it would help me figure out why I struggle. \n\nTo sum it up, I've had more of a chaotic childhood than I've ever realized. The more I'd realize this during therapy, the worse my anxiety would get. \n\nDoes anyone relate?

Did you clearly communicate what you want and your objectives for this session? Is the therapist trying all sorts of different approaches that don’t match what you have asked for? It could be due to many factors, and there are several steps that you both should work out throughout the sessions. Some people try different therapists to find one who best suits their needs and expertise. It's important to reassess and refocus your attention on what you truly need from therapy. So, I say keep trying, but since it’s been two years and you don’t see any hope with your current therapist, maybe it’s time to search for a new one."}
{"Reddit ID":"Anxiety_51","Reddit Post":"How 2 months of chronic stress has effected me physically I'm currently completing my A levels (a series of exam you do in the UK at the age of 17\/18, that determine whether you get into university)... as you can imagine, I have been stressed. I'm under a tremendous amount of pressure to get very high grades (straight A's). I've completed 2 exams, and have 5 left to go, 3 of which I'll be sitting tomorrow, the next day, and the day after that...\n\nI'm shocked at how this stress has effected me physically. I've always been fairly neurotic, but the anxiety I tend to feel is transient, and is rarely severe enough to manifest in anything physically significant, beyond a raised pulse and slight breathlessness.\n\nI knew I was getting myself *way* too worked up when I started to pull out hair in the shower. I have very thick hair, so a lot of it was coming out. I've had severe brain fog, which hasn't been the least bit helpful during a time when I have to be the most alert and *with it*'. I've had no appetite, and now my trousers are all loose, with one  pair literally falling down when I walk. The most bizarre symptom I've had is this weird jaw tension - my jaw is very clicky, and it feels incredibly tense and stiff. As a hypochondriac, I was convinced this was a heart attack, but I was reassured that it's probably just anxiety. I've had weird gastrointestinal symptoms, where I feel nauseous, and have this pit in my stomach all of the time, which could be caused by the lack of eating, but it persists even when I have eaten. \n\nAnd then of course feelings of impending doom, etc etc. \n\nI just can't wait for this to be over.","Appraisal Dimension ID":1,"Appraisal Dimension Description":"self-responsibility","Constitution":"Please help the narrator of the text reappraise the situation.

However, if the person is doing something wrong\/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person's perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation.

The repeated stress response can make your body unhealthy and ill.

What will happen after all this 'success' if you are no longer the healthy person you used to be? What’s left then?\nThe symptoms you listed are very common in people who are under high pressure and chronic stress.
