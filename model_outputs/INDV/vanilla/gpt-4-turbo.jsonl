At school the only advice I got was being told to hold my breath and count up to 10, well that and being told if I didn't grow up then I was going to go to prison.\n\nI have tried a lot of times - and with a lot of money - to manage my anger issues, but to be honest the feedback I've got from a few different counsellors and psychotherapists has been along the lines of \"well - everybody gets really angry sometimes\", \"you have Aspergers so it's quite normal\", \"you find yourself in a lot of situations at work and in your personal life that anybody would find stressful\".\n\nI've tried to DIY it with meditation and mindfulness, I know I need a 15 minute window to cool down after getting mad, I have tried antidepressants. Sometimes it seems like despite all of that, I just end up seeing red and ruining things.\n\nI think I am pretty clear *why* I get mad - in retrospect can rationalise it and go through what about a situation really frustrates me.\n\nI have an 18 month son and I can't stand to see him watch me get mad - I don't want to let anybody - especially him down with my temper.

When I read the message I immediately knew that they would not leave packages at our door because they literally never did and the entire team just seems fucking lazy. So lo and behold, i check my mailbox and see a \"sorry we missed you\" notice. I was home ALL DAY and the package was an amazon package which does not require a signature and they refused to deliver it to my door.\n\nI had to go to the post office to pick it up. When I get there I tell the lady and ask why I'm here essentially why can't they just deliver to my fucking door. She says that it'd take the workers too long to do that because our complex gets so many packages. I'm soo annoyed. I feel inconvenienced because of the drive there and how absolutely unnecessary this is. It's like the residents are being punished because we order packages. Ridiculous. This always happens when I'm inconvenienced and know that others are in the wrong.

I had anger issues in kindergarten and in elementary school and have been to a psychologist in second grade because my situation was that bad. Nowadays, the issues are much worse, I have lots of stress on me currently with online school and all kinds of things related to it, I am very tired because I am also not getting enough sleep.\n\nWhenever I get angry, I usually just have to smash whatever it is in my hand (controller, pen, notebook etc) against the surface that is closest to me, let it be my desk or bed. This has not only caused me and my family hundreds of dollars of damages, but I also usually get hurt in the process. Sure, wounds can heal, but having them in the first place because of a mental breakdown because my pen has dried out is a pretty fucked up thing in my book. \n\nI tried putting said things down before starting to hit something, but I just have zero self control and can't consistently do so. I also tried calming myself down by just staying still and doing nothing, but that usually gets me even more angry and I cause more harm to myself. I tried hitting other things like my pillows, but that causes almost the same effect as staying still. And after I break something I get sober and realize what I just did and get a bad feeling of doom or whatever that is.\n\nIs there any way I can at the very least minimize these breakouts?

She actually said she liked me 2 years prior (we have 1.5 years of online school), but I ghosted her which was very dumb and entirely my fault.

Sometimes, dreams can process emotions in abstract ways, which might not seem directly related to fear or anxiety. It's also possible that the tremors were a physiological response, like a drop in blood sugar or dehydration, rather than an emotional one. To manage this, consider practicing relaxation techniques before bed, such as deep breathing or meditation, and ensure you're staying hydrated and maintaining a balanced diet. If this continues, it might be worth discussing with a healthcare professional."}

I'm fine with phone calls, public speaking, all the classics. \n\nI get anxious when I have to do tasks that may reflect on my ability, intelligence, or self-worth. I also get anxious when I have to do things to achieve something that I care about. The sad thing is that I'm a huge procrastinator due to that. Avoidance and procrastination are how I cope. The issue is that it branched out so much it affects almost every activity. Most of the time though there is no other thing I should be doing. It's just me trying to do something, becoming more and more anxious and dropping it.\n\nIf I think I wanna work out, I'm anxious because I think I should be doing work.

If you work for an employer they normally work out how much tax etc you owe and it's deducted at source so what you get in your pay check is yours. But if you're self employed you have to fill in a tax return each year. You can fill in the return from the 6th April and it has to be done by 31st January the following year. So the tax return I've just submitted is for tax year 2020-2021.\n\nI hate doing my tax return. My accounts are really simple, profits easy to calculate and very few expenses. But I'm so paranoid I'll do something wrong. There's so many different fields to fill in and I have no clue what half of them mean. I've always asked my sister to sit with me in the past when I do my returns but this year I did it all on my own.\n\nTo further complicate matters my accounts last year are screwed up because of coronavirus. My income was down ~75% but I was eligible for a government support scheme called the Self Employment Income Support Scheme. However I then had to declare all these figures on my tax returns which was even more boxes to tick.\n\nI also had to claim my fifth grant which means working out my turnover for the last two years etc. and freaking out that I'll somehow claim the wrong amount or screw something up.\n\nIt took me two weeks of staring at the folder to build up the courage and then about half an hour ago I finally hit that sweet spot of the anxiety of not doing it outweighing the anxiety of doing it (the grant deadline is September).

{"Reddit ID": "o7lkru", "Reddit Post": "Recently, the Israeli government reinstituted its indoor mask mandate after about 300 Israelis were diagnosed with COVID-19. As a result, many people are fearing that COVID-19 restrictions will be constantly looming over us for the rest of human history, persistently drifting in and out of our lives. I'd like to explain why these fears simply are not rational. Despite what some say, Israel has not achieved herd immunity. They are very close, of course, but they are not at that milestone *yet.* About 5,160,000 Israelis are fully vaccinated, equivalent to roughly 56% of the Israeli population is fully vaccinated. Add that to all the Israelis who have attained natural immunity from the virus, and the percentage rate of immunity within Israel arrives at roughly 66%. For a group to have herd immunity to COVID-19, 70% must be immune. Because Israel has yet to achieve herd immunity, it is still possible for an outbreak to take place. Even with this in mind, the outbreak Israel has been facing is minuscule compared to the size of outbreaks at any point in 2020.

I've been doing a lot of thinking, lately, and I think I've finally got a handle on why the pandemic has been so chronically stressful for me, and others, over the past year. Specifically those in first world countries, in relation to how it affects us on a psychological level. As people, we tend to experience bad things as happening suddenly, all at once, and then you deal with them. A broken leg, a car wreak, getting fired, getting dumped, etc. Deeply unpleasant, but relatively short-duration things. These are type-1 and type-2 problems; Things which can be avoided, or which can be fixed. But the Coronavirus has loaded us all down with the third type of problem. The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part. Lots of us weren't doing too great before the pandemic hit, but then, after 15 months of slow, grinding lockdowns, endless bad news on top of bad news, and nowhere to go to get away from it... Is it really a wonder why everyone is so unhappy all the time? I feel like a machine that's trying harder and harder to run without lubricant, to the point that it's just scraping metal-on-metal, and every day is a bit harder than the last. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to keep this up. The possibility of a variant wave in the Fall, forcing us back into yet another lockdown, terrifies me. I can't relax, I can't focus, and it's been seven or eight months since I've had any meaningful hope for the future.

I (22f) got my first shot of Biontech last week and so did my sister. My mom is fully vaccinated with Moderna. My stepdad received his first shot of Biontech two days ago. But we also have two kids (age 5 and 3) in our family. Obviously they can't get vaccinated. Hearing that Delta is very transmissible, and often even infects vaccinated folk, scares me. I know efficiency of the vaccines was never 100% but I believed at least we'd be safe from Covid when we get vaccinated. I work full-time and go to school. At school, everyone wears a mask, we are 1,5m apart, the windows are open and everyone gets tested daily. At work, my coworker wears a mask and so do I. When I eat or drink I go outside. Otherwise, I don't take off my mask at all (I wear FFP2 or FFP3). My boss doesn't wear a mask but he only occasionally comes into our office. Also, everyone at my work place had Corona three months ago except me. They caught Alpha (B117). I also have to take public transit. Everyone wears masks. Windows are open. How big is my risk of infection? I have been getting regularly tested since March 21 (1 to 4 times a week) and it came back negative all the time, even when we had a high national incidence and infection was more likely. National incidence is now 5 cases per 100.000 people. In my town it is 3 cases per 100.000 people. At the moment, we have 49 active cases (my town is huge; 500.000 people live here).

I lived alone for several years before this and it used to be awesome for me but now it just feels painful. Im almost afraid of being alone. My anxiety is always bad in the mornings; I dont get a lot of sleep because of it which makes it difficult to focus at work. Also, my anxiety gives me get bad stomach aches and I lose my appetite so it makes it really hard to eat. I usually have to force myself to eat every day which just isnt fun. My work is partially opened up and Ive been trying to go in at least a few hours a day just to be around other humans. That helps for sure. Ive been trying to take early morning bike rides as soon as I get up and that typically helps but in the few hours before work starts, Im still rather anxious. Ive tried meditating (which kinda makes things worse), journaling, watching mindless TV, reaching out to friends, etc. I talk to a therapist on a weekly basis which has been helpful. I tried antidepressants (SSRIs) for about 6 months or so and they made my anxiety worse at first and I didnt feel like they were super helpful after that. TLDR; Any tips as to how to get out of my head and regain that sense of safety to be alone again after suffering anxiety because of the pandemic?", "Sub-Reddit": "r_covid19_support", "Model": "gpt-4-turbo", "reappraisal_question": "Please help the narrator of the text reappraise the situation.

While the last year and a half have been trying emotionally and professionally for all of us, things are looking up with the vaccine. However, my wife's parents refuse to get vaccinated. They are not in great health and my father-in-law specifically is older and I worry about his health. Therefore, even as things have started to open up, my family has been relatively more conservative, with no masks-free indoor interaction outside of the family, even with people that are vaccinated, for fear of spreading the virus to my inlaws. This is becoming a big problem because I am building a startup and my cofounder is someone I met during the pandemic. He and I need to start building a more regular working cadence and relationship, but this is really difficult since my wife and SIL are not comfortable with me working in person with him, even though he is vaccinated (though he is much less careful than us). For my part, I would like to push the company forward, and agree that our creative work would improve if we were able to work in-person a couple of times per week. I'm just at a loss - my wife is grieving what she perceives as the loss of her parents' sanity and doesn't want to cut them off, but I face real professional challenges (let alone the ongoing personal and mental health challenges) from continuing the status quo. Guiltily, I feel very angry at them - I feel like they are offloading responsibility for their safety on my wife, SIL, and myself, which seems extremely selfish.

From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all.

Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to. I feel like I've become so negative that I don't want to share my thoughts with people because I will bring them down, and I already feel like I pushed some people away by doing this. I emailed multiple psychiatrists, but only one answered me and had one short appointment, and told me I should continue looking because he doesn't have time for new patients.

I've always been extremely responsible, I've worn all the gear, all the time, gotten the training, and obey traffic laws.  My wife, bless her, has never pressured me to leave them behind.  In fact she pressures the exact opposite since she doesn't want to hear me gripe about not having a bike.\n\nMy son is thirteen months old.  Every time I leave on the bike I make sure the last thing I say to him, and my wife is that I love them.  A small part of this is too ensure that if I'm on the bike and my number comes up, the last thing I've said to them is the most important thing that needs to be said.\n\nI don't think I can do this anymore.  Today, while riding, I just couldn't stop thinking about how absurd my little ritual is since I'm actually out there doing something that increases the likely hood that my innocent \"I love you\" really will the last thing they hear me say.\n\nSo, I'm curious how other bikers dealt with this.

Laughing at my misery in putting him to bed!  I gave up in the bedroom and we went downstairs and watched some TV together.  Then he fell asleep within 30 minutes like a champ.**\n\n**Thanks for all the responses.

This past year has been upsetting to her, though.\n\nUp until about a year ago she spent her days with her grandparents. Then they left the country for a while, and she started daycare, which she enjoyed... she had no issues being away from us all day. Her grandparents came back in February, and at the same time, her little brother was born. She went back to staying with the grandparents during the day for the whole spring; then in the summer, grandparents had to leave again. During the summer she started to throw tantrums, especially around eating, but we took it in stride, dealt with it, and things got better. She doesn't do that anymore, though like a lot of kids she just doesn't like to eat much. But she gets enough nutrition.\n\nHer grandparents (who live with us) have been back again since September, and ever since, she panics whenever grandma leaves the room, unless it's just part of her routine. Routine separations are no issue; she's all smiles when mom and I leave for work in the mornings, she goes to bed without fussing. But if someone has to step out unexpectedly, she breaks down.\n\nLast night grandma had to run an errand. In the midst of crying, my daughter sprinted across the room and tripped, of course prompting sympathy from grandma. But something seemed off - there was nothing to trip on where she fell - so in my most gentle and sympathetic voice, after she calmed down, I asked her about it. She volunteered that she fell over on purpose.\n\nEvery time, within minutes of someone leaving, she's fine again, and showing no outward signs of stress.

It took a lot of guts but I think the [results](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=361522470538796&amp;set=a.361522117205498.90549.112331498791229&amp;type=1&amp;theater) speak for themselves.\n\nShe told me long ago the only chance I have to get pics like this is if a professional takes them. I figured it would never happen because they're very expensive and with two young kids on a single income, there was no way.  \n\nThen, a local boudoir photographer ran a contest where the winner gets a full set of photos and prints.  She's promised to do a full boudoir shoot for me if she wins this contest, and I could really use your support.\n\nThe winner is decided by Facebook \"Likes\", and I'd really appreciate the support of some fellow new parents.  I think it took a lot of guts to do this 6 months after having a baby, and it would mean a lot to her to win (she says she doesn't feel \"sexy\" anymore). \n\nedit: Thanks very much for all your support and nice comments!\n\nIf you wouldn't mind, could you help me show her she IS still sexy by \"Liking\" [this photo?](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=361522470538796&amp;set=a.361522117205498.90549.112331498791229&amp;type=1&amp;theater)\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention the pics are not nude, she's wearing panties and a shirt.

{"Reddit ID": "kbb6v", "Reddit Post": "One of my kids is in the first grade.  They started school at the beginning of August.  The teacher sits at her desk basically all day while the kids do worksheets that are overly simplistic even for their young age.  Friday, she sent home progress reports.  The scores just didn't really fit my son's strengths and weaknesses.  A friend that also has a child in the class and I compared notes and the scores for both children were exactly the same-all 19 of them.  So, I'm guessing she just filled this evaluation the same for each student.  What do you think I should do about it?  I don't want to alienate her considering she is my kid's teacher, but this doesn't seem right.  I'm new at this school thing (as a parent) and would love your opinions.

It hurts my pride so bad, but this little angel is the world to me and i need to be prepared as much as i can. I am due Nov 15. I do work, but im in the process of moving out of my sisters so EVERY cent i am making is going towards finding a new place while paying her for the time i am still here. I am not asking for money at all, but i am asking for any items for a baby girl that are in good condition.\n\nMy friend suggested this website on babycenter, so I was just giving it a try! lol\n\nI live in BIRIMINGHAM AL. i do have a walmart registry!\n\nThank you all for just reading this, God bless you all!", "Sub-Reddit": "r_parenting", "Model": "gpt-4-turbo", "reappraisal_question": "Please help the narrator of the text reappraise the situation.

{"Reddit ID": "qq7je", "Reddit Post": "So last night I went to bed early and told the kids they could stay up if they acted like humans. \n\nWithin a quarter of an hour I've got an eye cracked and I'm poking my husband in the back and asking something I never thought I'd hear myself say... \"Are they breakdance-fighting to classical music?\". It sounded like they were flinging sacks of taters around and everyone was yelling things like \"Get him!\" and \"Pin him!\". And over the top of it all was Mozart at a kabillion decibels. \n\nBut man, I was proud! Mozart! Wow. Of all my LP's to play, they picked Mozart! Feeling quite smug I hollered down: TURN DOWN YOUR GODDAMNED MOZART!!!\n\nEverything downstairs went still and quiet. Then my daughter, in that \"talking to retards\" voice only a teenage girl can do called back up:\n\n\"It's BEETHOVEN, Mom!\"", "Sub-Reddit": "r_parenting", "Model": "gpt-4-turbo", "reappraisal_question": "Please help the narrator of the text reappraise the situation.

{"Reddit ID": "ref2a", "Reddit Post": "Would you tell your child in an age appropriate way that you were molested?\n\nMy reasoning for wanting to do this is to protect them from this happening to them, and if they were in the situation they would know what was happening and would have the tools to remove themselves from an awful situation.\n\nMy mom always said no one is allowed to touch my privates when I was little but my sexual interference involved my friends older brother rubbing his penis all over my body, because he never touched my privates I didnt think it was wrong (although I knew deep down that this shouldnt happen) I didnt know how to get out of the situation so I just sat there in shame while it happened to me. I never told my mom and this happened 20 years ago...My daughter is a few months away from the age I was when that happened and I would die if someone stole her innocence like that. \n\nWhat do you think about telling your children about sexual molestation/interference?\n  and how it can be anything from a subtle butt grab, breast cupping, rubbing, looking at porn, dirty talk... all the way up to full on rape. And if they scream and run they can get out of most of these situations.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_parenting", "Model": "gpt-4-turbo", "reappraisal_question": "Please help the narrator of the text reappraise the situation. Your response should be concise and brief.", "reappraisal_output": "It's important to educate your child on personal boundaries and body safety in an age-appropriate manner. You can explain that no one should touch them in a way that makes them uncomfortable, and they have the right to say no and seek help from a trusted adult. Emphasize that they can always come to you with any concerns, and practice scenarios where they learn to assert their boundaries. This approach empowers them with knowledge and tools to protect themselves without sharing the details of your personal trauma."}
