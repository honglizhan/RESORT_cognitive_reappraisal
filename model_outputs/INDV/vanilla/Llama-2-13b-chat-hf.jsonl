This, combined with the narrator's own experiences of night terrors and fear of eyes, suggests that there may have been a strong emotional and psychological component to the events described.\n\nIt's possible that the narrator's father may have been experiencing some form of intermittent explosive disorder or other anger management issues, which could have been triggered by various stimuli, including loud noises or perceived slights. The fact that the narrator's father was able to return to a normal state the next day suggests that these episodes may have been temporary and potentially related to stress or other external factors.\n\nIn terms of the narrator's own experiences, the night terrors and fear of eyes may have been related to the stress and anxiety caused by living with a parent who struggled with anger management. It's possible that these experiences may have been a manifestation of the narrator's own emotional and psychological response to the situation.\n\nOverall, it may be helpful for the narrator to seek out professional help and support to process these experiences and gain a better understanding of their underlying causes.

Take a break: When you feel yourself getting angry, take a step back and remove yourself from the situation. Go for a walk, take some deep breaths, or engage in a calming activity to help you regain control.\n5. Seek professional help: Consider returning to therapy or seeking a new therapist who can help you address the underlying issues contributing to your anger.\n\nRemember, managing anger and improving your reaction takes time and effort, but it's worth it to improve your relationships and overall well-being."}

I know there are things I have to do for myself and I'm working on it but I really am struggling horribly with the dating scene. I believed it was because I'm ugly but I don't want to think that so I'm trying to erase that. People have told me in attractive but I remain skeptical at times. I haven't had a date in about 8 months and have barely gotten any likes or matches on eharmony, tinder, and bumble. I'm on 3 dating apps and I can't even get a girls number you read that right. I just don't know why I'm so disconnected from the dating scene. I cant blame it on girls losing interest because that's not the case at all. I never even get any interest to even get a response that's not a rejection. I don't know what it is. I'm not a total turn off, I'm funny, I'm fairly intelligent, I make good money, I'm fun to be around, I'm a vet and I have good taste in clothing.

It sounds like you're struggling with feeling disconnected from the dating scene and questioning your self-worth based on your lack of success in finding a partner. Here are a few things to consider that might help you reappraise the situation:\n\n1. Online dating can be tough: With so many people using dating apps and websites, it can be difficult to stand out and get noticed. Don't be too hard on yourself if you're not getting as many matches or likes as you'd like.\n2. Looks aren't everything: While physical attraction is important, it's not the only factor that determines someone's worth or their ability to be a good partner. Focus on developing your personality, interests, and values, and don't sell yourself short based on your appearance.\n3. There's more to dating than just looks: Dating is about finding a connection with someone, not just about physical attraction. Consider what you have to offer in terms of personality, humor, intelligence, and shared interests.\n4. Rejection is normal: Everyone experiences rejection in dating at some point, and it's not a reflection of your worth as a person. Keep trying and don't give up!\n5. Focus on what you can control: Instead of focusing on what you think you're doing wrong, try to focus on what you can control, such as being genuine, kind, and open-minded.\n\nRemember, dating is a process and it may take some time to find someone who is a good match for you. Don't be too hard on yourself, and try to enjoy the journey rather than focusing on the end goal. Good luck!"}

It sounds like you are experiencing a lot of anger and frustration towards your mom, and it's understandable that you want to find a way to stop feeling this way. Here are a few things you might consider:\n\n1. Practice self-compassion: It's okay to feel angry and frustrated sometimes, especially when someone is doing something that bothers you. Instead of beating yourself up for feeling this way, try to be kind and understanding towards yourself.\n2. Set boundaries: It sounds like you have asked your mom multiple times to let you know before touching your clothes, so it might be helpful to set a more formal boundary. You could try saying something like, \"I would appreciate it if you could ask me before touching my clothes, as it makes me feel uncomfortable when you don't.\"\n3. Communicate your needs clearly: Instead of getting angry or pretending to yell, try to communicate your needs clearly and calmly. For example, you could say, \"I need you to let me know before touching my clothes, as it makes me feel uncomfortable when you don't.\"\n4. Take a step back: When you start to feel angry or frustrated, try to take a step back and take a few deep breaths. This can help you calm down and gain perspective.\n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful!

It's possible that your brother may also be experiencing cognitive difficulties, such as memory loss, difficulty with concentration, and problem-solving skills.\n\nIn terms of managing his anger issues, it may be helpful to seek out professional help from a therapist or counselor who specializes in working with children and adolescents with neurological conditions. They can provide your brother with the tools and strategies he needs to manage his emotions and develop healthier communication skills.\n\nAdditionally, your parents may want to consider seeking out support groups for families of children with neurological conditions. These groups can provide a safe space to share experiences, receive emotional support, and learn from others who have gone through similar challenges.\n\nFinally, it may be worth exploring alternative therapies that can help your brother manage his symptoms. For example, occupational therapy can help him develop skills to improve his daily functioning and independence, while speech therapy can help him improve his communication skills.\n\nOverall, it's important to remember that there are many resources available to help your brother and your family navigate these challenges. It may take some time and experimentation to find the right combination of therapies and strategies that work best for him, but with the right support and resources, it is possible to make significant progress."}

Instead, you're feeling disproportionately angry and hollow inside afterward. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as changes in your life, relationships, or stress levels. It's important to recognize that anger is a normal emotion, but it's not healthy to let it consume you.\n\nOne strategy to reappraise the situation is to try to identify the underlying causes of your anger. Are there specific triggers that you're not addressing? Are there other emotions, such as frustration or sadness, that you're not allowing yourself to feel? By understanding the root of your anger, you may be able to find healthier ways to express and manage your emotions. Additionally, practicing self-care, such as exercise, mindfulness, or talking to a trusted friend or therapist, can help you regulate your emotions and find a sense of balance."}

This clearly isn't healthy however I never get like this when theirs other people around, if I play a game with friends (in person) I completely chill and the least competitive person their is, can anyone please help me figure this out?

This reaction is understandable, but it's important to recognize that it's not healthy to express this anger by smashing things or getting overly competitive.\n\nHere are a few suggestions that may help you reappraise the situation and manage your emotions better:\n\n1. Take a step back: When you start to feel frustrated, take a deep breath and step away from the technology or game for a moment. This can help you calm down and gain perspective.\n2. Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness techniques can help you become more aware of your thoughts and emotions, and can help you manage your reactions. Try focusing on the present moment and letting go of negative thoughts.\n3. Reframe your thinking: Instead of getting angry at technology or games, try to see them as opportunities for growth and learning. Viewing challenges as opportunities can help you approach them with a more positive mindset.\n4. Find healthy outlets: Instead of smashing things, try finding healthy outlets for your frustration, such as going for a walk, doing some exercise, or talking to a friend.\n\nRemember, it's okay to feel frustrated sometimes, but it's important to manage those emotions in a healthy way. With practice, you can learn to respond to technology and gaming challenges in a more positive and productive way."}

Be respectful of her boundaries: If she seems busy or not interested in talking, respect her boundaries and don't push the issue. A simple \"hello, how are you?\" is enough to show your interest without being overbearing.\n3. Find common ground: If you do manage to strike up a conversation, try to find something you both have in common to talk about. This can help create a sense of connection and make the conversation feel more natural.\n4. Be yourself: It's okay to be nervous, but try not to let your anxiety take over. Be yourself, and let your genuine interest in reconnecting with her shine through.\n\nRemember, there is no guarantee that she will be interested in reconnecting, and that's okay.

I have this great fear of the world just turning out like Wall-e, where everyone just sits around, while robots do all the work.

The job itself isn't bad, i find myself liking talking to customers and my co workers are really nice, but i feel really underprepared in terms of training, obviously since it's my second day, but they already had me on the bar and in the drive through and i feel as though if this is how quickly they expect me to be able to work efficiently with the rest of the team then i am fked .

Buspirone can help you feel more focused and relaxed, and it may also help improve your mood and cognitive function.\n\nAnother option is gabapentin, which is primarily used to treat seizures and nerve pain but has also been found to have anxiolytic effects.

This is my first time posting on here. I will be 19 in two days, I have been struggling with anxiety, and depression for about three years now, at least that's when it got really bad. I panic through out all day almost every day about every little thing and I am in bed all day every day, too scared to stay standing up for longer than going to get food or to the bathroom before I run back to my bed. This has gotten so bad I'm unable to work, socialize with friends and family, or do something as simple as take my dog for a walk. I am barely holding on and I can't handle much more of this. I was prescribed Cipralex a few months ago and I only took that for a few days because medication is one of the many things that give me anxiety, and than I search every little thing and scare myself into even feeling sick. Today I was prescribed sertraline, and I even went to pick it up and it's in my medicine cabinet now. I read up on this medication for so long and I'm so scared to start it not knowing what to expect, so I guess I'm just looking for advice and to hear other peoples stories and hopefully gain some motivation and courage to start this medication that could potentially change my life.

Consult with your prescribing doctor: Discuss your concerns and history of Xanax abuse with your doctor. They may be able to adjust your dosage or recommend alternative treatments.\n2. Set boundaries: Establish a clear plan for taking Buspar, such as only taking it as directed and not taking more than the prescribed dose.\n3. Monitor your use: Keep track of how much Buspar you're taking and how often you're taking it. This can help you identify any potential misuse or abuse.\n4. Seek support: Consider talking to a therapist or support group about your anxiety and your history of substance abuse. They can provide guidance and support in managing your anxiety and avoiding relapse.\n\nRemember, it's important to take Buspar as directed by your doctor and to be mindful of your history of substance abuse.

It's understandable that you are concerned about your health, but it's important to reassess the situation and challenge some of the negative thoughts that may be contributing to your anxiety.\n\nHere are a few things to consider:\n\n1. The sensations you are experiencing in your legs, such as tension and sensations in the backside of your knee and around your ankle, are not uncommon and can have many harmless causes.\n2. The fact that you have no known risk factors for blood clots and have not experienced any specific symptoms suggests that the likelihood of a blood clot is low.\n3. The vein specialist you saw has already checked your left leg and is now focusing on your right leg. This suggests that they do not see any clear indication of a blood clot.\n4. It's possible that your anxiety is exacerbating your perception of the sensations in your legs, making them feel more intense than they actually are.\n\nIt may be helpful to speak with a mental health professional who can work with you to address your health anxiety and help you reappraise the situation in a more balanced way. Additionally, you may want to consider practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation, to help manage your anxiety."}

{"Reddit ID": "Anxiety_111", "Reddit Post": "Just wanted to share with someone that I filed my tax return all on my own!\n\nFor those outside England a quick simplified brief on our tax system.  If you work for an employer they normally work out how much tax etc you owe and it's deducted at source so what you get in your pay check is yours. But if you're self employed you have to fill in a tax return each year. You can fill in the return from the 6th April and it has to be done by 31st January the following year. So the tax return I've just submitted is for tax year 2020-2021.\n\nI hate doing my tax return. My accounts are really simple, profits easy to calculate and very few expenses. But I'm so paranoid I'll do something wrong. There's so many different fields to fill in and I have no clue what half of them mean. I've always asked my sister to sit with me in the past when I do my returns but this year I did it all on my own.\n\nTo further complicate matters my accounts last year are screwed up because of coronavirus. My income was down ~75% but I was eligible for a government support scheme called the Self Employment Income Support Scheme. However I then had to declare all these figures on my tax returns which was even more boxes to tick.\n\nI also had to claim my fifth grant which means working out my turnover for the last two years etc. and freaking out that I'll somehow claim the wrong amount or screw something up.\n\nIt took me two weeks of staring at the folder to build up the courage and then about half an hour ago I finally hit that sweet spot of the anxiety of not doing it outweighing the anxiety of doing it (the grant deadline is September). So here I am just after midnight waiting for the anxiety adrenaline rush to die down so I can actually get some sleep.\n\nBut I did it! I just needed to share with someone as I'm really proud of myself.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_anxiety", "Model": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "reappraisal_question": "Please help the narrator of the text reappraise the situation.

It's okay to prioritize your own needs and well-being, even if it means taking a different path than what others may expect of you.\n\nOne thing you might consider is talking to a trusted adult, such as a parent or a school counselor, about how you're feeling. They may be able to offer you some support and guidance as you navigate this situation. Additionally, you might try engaging in some self-care activities, such as taking a warm bath, listening to calming music, or practicing deep breathing exercises, to help you feel more relaxed and centered. Remember that you don't have to go through this alone, and there are people and resources available to support you."}

He was the kindest and purest human being. I met him briefly yesterday as we took him to the hospital. Today he passed away from COVID, he was deathly afraid from needles and the vaccination. I feel so so powerless. So guilty I didnt reply to his phone call 3 days earlier as my family was also sick of Covid and I was caring for them. The death feels like it could have been avoided, he took the remaining precautions but it didnt work. At least he died happy alongside his family in his hometown where I live. I dont know what or how to live life without him in my mind, without meeting him ever again, with seeing the same places without him. Im tired, I want to cry. We both hated living at home now I am stuck living on earth without him, I feel this home is the right place for me - was waiting eagerly for him to return.

{"Reddit ID": "o7lkru", "Reddit Post": "Recently, the Israeli government reinstituted its indoor mask mandate after about 300 Israelis were diagnosed with COVID-19. As a result, many people are fearing that COVID-19 restrictions will be constantly looming over us for the rest of human history, persistently drifting in and out of our lives. I'd like to explain why these fears simply are not rational. Despite what some say, Israel has not achieved herd immunity. They are very close, of course, but they are not at that milestone *yet.* About 5,160,000 Israelis are fully vaccinated, equivalent to roughly 56% of the Israeli population is fully vaccinated. Add that to all the Israelis who have attained natural immunity from the virus, and the percentage rate of immunity within Israel arrives at roughly 66%. For a group to have herd immunity to COVID-19, 70% must be immune. Because Israel has yet to achieve herd immunity, it is still possible for an outbreak to take place. Even with this in mind, the outbreak Israel has been facing is minuscule compared to the size of outbreaks at any point in 2020. Additionally, many of the people infected are kids, of whom the Israeli medical establishment has only vaccinated a small amount.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_covid19_support", "Model": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "reappraisal_question": "Please help the narrator of the text reappraise the situation.

Additionally, the recent outbreak is small compared to those in 2020, and the majority of those infected are children who have not yet been fully vaccinated. These factors suggest that the situation is not as dire as feared and that the country is making progress in its efforts to contain the virus.\""}

A week ago I put in a full exercise. About 24 hours later, I don't feel like I felt when I had Covid, but I definitely feel the exact same as I did *after* I had gotten my first shot - mild discomfort in lymph nodes, some weakness.

I've been doing a lot of thinking, lately, and I think I've finally got a handle on why the pandemic has been so chronically stressful for me, and others, over the past year. Specifically those in first world countries, in relation to how it affects us on a psychological level. As people, we tend to experience bad things as happening suddenly, all at once, and then you deal with them. A broken leg, a car wreak, getting fired, getting dumped, etc. Deeply unpleasant, but relatively short-duration things. These are type-1 and type-2 problems; Things which can be avoided, or which can be fixed. But the Coronavirus has loaded us all down with the third type of problem. The kind that just needs to be coped with, and waited out, against which you can do basically nothing except endure. And... we are really, really bad at just holding tight and doing nothing. Especially since the pandemic has stripped us of most of our usual coping mechanisms. Our comfortable distractions, eating out with friends, seeing a movie, big events and holidays to look forward to. That's been the truly soul-crushing part. Lots of us weren't doing too great before the pandemic hit, but then, after 15 months of slow, grinding lockdowns, endless bad news on top of bad news, and nowhere to go to get away from it... Is it really a wonder why everyone is so unhappy all the time? I feel like a machine that's trying harder and harder to run without lubricant, to the point that it's just scraping metal-on-metal, and every day is a bit harder than the last. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to keep this up. The possibility of a variant wave in the Fall, forcing us back into yet another lockdown, terrifies me. I can't relax, I can't focus, and it's been seven or eight months since I've had any meaningful hope for the future.

Rather, the organization is taking a precautionary approach to protect all individuals, including those who may be more vulnerable to severe illness, such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions.\n\nThe WHO's recommendation is based on the current situation and the high transmissibility of the Delta variant, which has been detected in many countries with high and low vaccination rates. While vaccination rates in the US and other countries with high vaccination rates are high, there are still some individuals who are not fully vaccinated or have not had the opportunity to receive the vaccine yet. Therefore, the WHO's recommendation is intended to protect everyone, regardless of their vaccination status.\n\nIt's important to note that the WHO is a reputable and trustworthy organization that is committed to protecting global public health. The organization's recommendations are based on the best available scientific evidence and are intended to save lives and prevent the spread of the virus.

I (22f) got my first shot of Biontech last week and so did my sister. My mom is fully vaccinated with Moderna. My stepdad received his first shot of Biontech two days ago. But we also have two kids (age 5 and 3) in our family. Obviously they can't get vaccinated. Hearing that Delta is very transmissible, and often even infects vaccinated folk, scares me. I know efficiency of the vaccines was never 100% but I believed at least we'd be safe from Covid when we get vaccinated. I work full-time and go to school. At school, everyone wears a mask, we are 1,5m apart, the windows are open and everyone gets tested daily. At work, my coworker wears a mask and so do I. When I eat or drink I go outside. Otherwise, I don't take off my mask at all (I wear FFP2 or FFP3). My boss doesn't wear a mask but he only occasionally comes into our office. Also, everyone at my work place had Corona three months ago except me. They caught Alpha (B117). I also have to take public transit. Everyone wears masks. Windows are open. How big is my risk of infection? I have been getting regularly tested since March 21 (1 to 4 times a week) and it came back negative all the time, even when we had a high national incidence and infection was more likely. National incidence is now 5 cases per 100.000 people. In my town it is 3 cases per 100.000 people. At the moment, we have 49 active cases (my town is huge; 500.000 people live here).

Here is a reappraisal of the situation:\n\nWhile it is true that there has been an increase in COVID-19 cases in some parts of the US, it is important to note that the vaccination effort has been highly effective in reducing the number of severe cases and hospitalizations. In fact, the CDC reports that vaccination has prevented an estimated 14 million cases and 850,000 hospitalizations in the US alone.\n\nFurthermore, the Delta variant is not a new strain of the virus, but rather a mutation of the original strain that was first detected in India in December 2020. While it is more contagious than previous strains, it is still vulnerable to the same vaccines and treatments that have been effective against other strains.\n\nIn New Jersey, where the narrator resides, the situation appears to be stable, with no explosive growth in cases. This suggests that the public health measures in place, such as mask mandates and social distancing, are effective in controlling the spread of the virus.\n\nOverall, while it is important to remain vigilant and continue to take precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the situation is not as dire as the narrator suggests.

FWIW, I also live thousands of miles from all of my family. My anxiety got pretty bad several months ago during the holidays when Covid was at its peak and was impossible to see people. I was also still furloughed from work and had a lot of time to think (and overthink). Ive dealt with mild anxiety in the past but nothing like this.

I say \"covid filtration efficiency\" because I'm not exactly sure what I should be looking for. I assume I should be looking at \"viral filtration efficiency\" scores/tests but for what particle size? I seem to recall hearing that your typical covid aerosol is about 0.3 micrometers in diameter but I could definitely be wrong about that.

Certainly, I want to avoid risking spreading the virus to others in the case that I become infected (I suppose one might argue that with properly wearing a very protective mask I am unlikely to be infected in the first place. Don't ask me about the legitimacy of that argument though) The goal here is to get a mask with a high degree of protection against covid.

Your response should be concise and brief.", "reappraisal_output": "Based on your concerns, it seems that you are looking for a mask with high filtration efficiency against COVID-19, specifically the delta variant. While 95% filtration efficiency may not be enough for your needs, it's important to note that no mask can guarantee 100% protection against the virus.\n\nTo better assess the filtration efficiency of masks, you should look for tests conducted by reputable organizations such as NIOSH or ISO. These tests evaluate the mask's ability to filter out particles of different sizes, including viral particles.\n\nRegarding the size of COVID-19 aerosols, studies suggest that they are typically in the range of 0.02 to 0.3 micrometers in diameter. However, it's important to note that the size of the virus can vary depending on the strain and the conditions under which it is transmitted.\n\nTo minimize the risk of spreading the virus, it's important to wear a mask that fits snugly over your nose and mouth and has multiple layers of fabric. You may also want to consider wearing gloves and frequently sanitizing your hands to reduce the risk of transmission.\n\nIn summary, while no mask can guarantee 100% protection against COVID-19, looking for masks with high filtration efficiency and following proper hygiene practices can help reduce the risk of transmission."}

{"Reddit ID": "of5i44", "Reddit Post": "One of my close family members is getting married in August. This pandemic has given me pretty bad health anxiety, and I still feel super uncomfortable being indoors with such a large group (100-150 people), especially since I live in an area where vaccination rates are under 50% and very few people wear masks (even unvaccinated). I know for sure there will be people at the wedding who are unvaccinated and unmasked. I also got the J&amp;J vaccine, and its effectiveness against delta seems somewhat unclear. Im debating whether or not I can even attend because just the thought of being inside with that many people unmasked (and some unvaccinated) gives me extreme anxiety.

Your response should be concise and brief.", "reappraisal_output": "Based on the information provided, it sounds like you are experiencing significant health anxiety due to the pandemic and the potential risks of attending a large indoor gathering with unvaccinated and unmasked individuals. Here are a few perspectives that may help you reappraise the situation:\n\n1. Vaccination is the best protection: While the effectiveness of the J&J vaccine against the delta variant may be unclear, it is still the best protection you have against severe illness and hospitalization. As a vaccinated individual, you are significantly less likely to contract COVID-19 or experience severe symptoms.\n2. Masks provide additional protection: Wearing a mask can significantly reduce your risk of contracting COVID-19, even if others around you are not wearing masks. Consider wearing a high-quality mask that fits snugly over your nose and mouth to provide maximum protection.\n3. Social distancing is key: While it may be challenging to maintain social distancing in a crowded room, try to position yourself in a way that allows you to maintain a safe distance from others. This may mean arriving early to secure a spot near the back of the room or finding a spot outside where you can observe the proceedings from a safe distance.\n4. Assess the risks and benefits: Before making a decision about attending the wedding, carefully assess the risks and benefits of doing so. Consider the potential risks of contracting COVID-19, as well as the potential benefits of attending the wedding and celebrating with your loved ones.\n5. Prioritize your health: Ultimately, your health and well-being should be your top priority. If attending the wedding would cause you extreme anxiety or put your health at risk, it may be better to prioritize your own needs and opt out of the event.\n\nI hope these perspectives help you reappraise the situation and make a decision that is best for your health and well-being."}

Before I got vaccinated, I was in constant in fear of dying, spreading it to someone high risk, or my family getting sick/dying. My immediate family knows that I suffer with it, but no one aside from my brother really understands the levity of how crippling it can be. I barely leave the house cuz of it now and have to put ointment on my skin because I've been oversanitizing/overwashing to the point where my skin bleeds and cracks. My immediate family isn't against COVID safety by any means, but they definitely make me feel crazy for still wanting to disinfect everything and everything else. The family that's coming hasn't been the safest during COVID. They're now all fully vaccinated, but I'm extremely anxious to be around them and that some freak outbreak could happen between us. I'm trying to set boundaries and minimize exposure, but knowing my family, feeling the weight of their judgment will also give me immense anxiety.

Well she's my friend as well since I know her since I was little because her son is one of my best friends growing up. There will probably be 50ish guests there (don't know exactly, could be more). It is planned to be a garden party but forecast says rain, so it's probably indoors. It's in my hometown, so I would need to travel there a few hours to attend. I haven't seen many of the people attending there since last year including some of my friends. Mainly because I didn't want to meet because of the virus. I only texted with them. Cases are very low (sometimes zero) there. Some people there are fully vaccinated, some got their 1st shot and some haven't yet. I got my first shot 3 weeks ago(Moderna). I haven't met such a big group since last summer. Only smaller groups and always outdoors. You can probably tell by now that I'm a very careful person when it comes to dealing with the virus.

{"Reddit ID": "og9qaf", "Reddit Post": "Hi everyone - thank you for the support shown in this forum. Since March 2020, I've been in a COVID bubble with my wife, sister-in-law, and their parents. While the last year and a half have been trying emotionally and professionally for all of us, things are looking up with the vaccine. However, my wife's parents refuse to get vaccinated. They are not in great health and my father-in-law specifically is older and I worry about his health. Therefore, even as things have started to open up, my family has been relatively more conservative, with no masks-free indoor interaction outside of the family, even with people that are vaccinated, for fear of spreading the virus to my inlaws. This is becoming a big problem because I am building a startup and my cofounder is someone I met during the pandemic. He and I need to start building a more regular working cadence and relationship, but this is really difficult since my wife and SIL are not comfortable with me working in person with him, even though he is vaccinated (though he is much less careful than us). For my part, I would like to push the company forward, and agree that our creative work would improve if we were able to work in-person a couple of times per week. I'm just at a loss - my wife is grieving what she perceives as the loss of her parents' sanity and doesn't want to cut them off, but I face real professional challenges (let alone the ongoing personal and mental health challenges) from continuing the status quo. Guiltily, I feel very angry at them - I feel like they are offloading responsibility for their safety on my wife, SIL, and myself, which seems extremely selfish.

From November 2020 until May 2021, restaurants were take-out only in Munich and we could only meet one person from another household. They are now finally open both inside and outside, but clubs and bars are still closed, we can only meet up to 10 friends privately, and we have to wear an FFP2 mask inside (stores, public transport) and walking around a Biergarten (which have 1/3 of tables closed still). Now we are approaching herd immunity levels finally, but there is no talk about when restrictions will finally be removed at all. The news focuses on spreading fear about the Delta variant constantly, and many people are expecting another lockdown in fall/winter despite vaccinations. Vaccinations are humanity's only hope to fight back against this virus, and if these don't work against some variants (even though all evidence so far says they do work), then there's nothing we can do. The notion of creating another lockdown to wait for a better vaccine is absolutely ridiculous because humans will never beat nature in this race. The best chance we have is to vaccinate as much as possible with what we have and take some risks again by opening up. I don't think I can mentally survive another lockdown, and if it happens I feel like I need to get out of Germany. I feel like it's hard to talk to people anymore. Most of the time when I see someone I know, I try to avoid talking to them because it's easier not to. I feel like I've become so negative that I don't want to share my thoughts with people because I will bring them down, and I already feel like I pushed some people away by doing this. I emailed multiple psychiatrists, but only one answered me and had one short appointment, and told me I should continue looking because he doesn't have time for new patients.

The delta variant is a new and highly contagious strain of the virus, and it is important to take precautions to prevent its spread, such as wearing masks, social distancing, and practicing good hygiene.\n3. The African American community has been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, and it is important to address the systemic issues that have led to this disparity, such as lack of access to healthcare and other resources.\n4.

Start by offering him a few sips of water or milk in a cup, and gradually increase the amount over time. This can help him get used to the taste and texture of other liquids without feeling like he's giving up breastfeeding entirely.\n\nAdditionally, you could try offering him a pacifier or other comfort object to help him transition from breastfeeding. This can help him learn to self-soothe and may make it easier for him to accept other liquids.\n\nRemember, every child is different, so it's important to go at your son's own pace and not force him to give up breastfeeding before he's ready. With patience and consistency, he will eventually learn to accept other liquids and transition away from breastfeeding."}

Every time I leave on the bike I make sure the last thing I say to him, and my wife is that I love them.  A small part of this is too ensure that if I'm on the bike and my number comes up, the last thing I've said to them is the most important thing that needs to be said.\n\nI don't think I can do this anymore.  Today, while riding, I just couldn't stop thinking about how absurd my little ritual is since I'm actually out there doing something that increases the likely hood that my innocent \"I love you\" really will the last thing they hear me say.\n\nSo, I'm curious how other bikers dealt with this.

Based on what you've shared, it sounds like you're considering home-schooling your daughter as an alternative to traditional public education. While there are certainly pros and cons to both options, here are a few things to consider that might help you reappraise the situation:\n\n1. Flexibility: Home-schooling offers a lot of flexibility in terms of pacing and content, which can be especially helpful if your daughter has specific learning needs or interests.\n2. Personalized attention: With home-schooling, you'll have the opportunity to give your daughter one-on-one attention and tailor her education to her individual needs and learning style.\n3. Reduced peer pressure: Home-schooling can reduce the pressure to conform to peer norms and can allow your daughter to develop at her own pace.\n4. Increased family time: Home-schooling can provide an opportunity for increased family time and bonding, which can be especially valuable if you have a close relationship with your daughter.\n5. Potential for better socialization: By participating in home-schooling co-ops or clubs, your daughter can still have opportunities for socialization and make friends with other children who are also being home-schooled.\n\nOn the other hand, there are also some potential drawbacks to consider, such as the potential for social isolation, the need for a significant amount of time and effort from both you and your daughter, and the possibility that your daughter may miss out on certain opportunities or experiences that are available in traditional public education.\n\nUltimately, the decision of whether to home-school or send your daughter to traditional public school will depend on your family's values, lifestyle, and priorities.

It sounds like you're doing a great job of explaining complex concepts to your child in a way that she can understand, but the topic of the internet and technology can be particularly challenging for kids (and adults!) to grasp.\n\nOne strategy you might consider is to use analogies or metaphors to help your child understand these concepts. For example, you could explain that the internet is like a big library where you can find information on just about anything, or that messaging apps are like a special kind of mailbox where you can send messages to your friends.\n\nAdditionally, you might try using visual aids like diagrams or pictures to help your child visualize these concepts. This can make them feel more concrete and easier to understand.\n\nOverall, it's great that you're taking the time to explain these concepts to your child in a way that she can understand, and with a little creativity and patience, I'm sure you'll be able to help her make sense of the internet and technology."}

It's not uncommon for young children to resist changes in their routine and environment, especially when it comes to sleep.\n\nConsidering your son's history of fussiness at bedtime and his tendency to wake up frequently during the night, it may be helpful to establish a consistent bedtime routine that includes a calming activity, such as reading a book or singing a lullaby. This can help signal to your son that it's time for sleep.\n\nAdditionally, you may want to try phasing out the bottle and switching to a sippy cup or straw, as this can help your son learn to self-soothe and fall asleep more easily.\n\nIt's also important to remember that it's normal for young children to resist sleep and fight bedtime, especially if they're feeling overtired or overstimulated. Keep in mind that it may take some time for your son to adjust to the new bed and routine, but with consistency, patience, and a little creativity, you can help make the transition smoother for both of you."}

{"Reddit ID": "ee559", "Reddit Post": "Hello all - my husband and I have been trying to figure out if the amount of attention we get in public with our little girl is normal.  She's 8 months old and as cute as can be.  The thing is - we get a LOT of attention when we go out with her.  Is this normal?  She's our first, and I was in no way prepared for the number of people who would stop us, want to see her, want to take pictures of her, want to ooohh and ahhh over her all the time.  \n\nI'm sure as she gets a little older, this will decrease.  It was flattering at first, but it's beginning to be a bit of a hassle sometimes.  For example, I took her to Chipotle for lunch today.  While I ate (20 minutes) nine different people came up to me to talk about her.  It made it really hard to finish my meal.  At the same time, I noticed that another baby in the restaurant who was around the same age didn't get any of this attention.  \n\nSo, parents of reddit, is this a reasonable amount of attention to expect when taking a baby out in public?

Set boundaries: It's okay to politely decline when people approach you and your baby. You can say something like, \"We're trying to finish our meal/activity, so we'd appreciate some space.\"\n2. Use a baby carrier: Wearing your baby in a carrier can help keep them close to you and reduce the amount of attention they receive.\n3. Avoid peak hours: Try to plan your outings during less busy times, such as early in the morning or later in the evening, to minimize the number of people around.\n4. Keep hand sanitizer handy: Make sure to keep hand sanitizer with you and use it frequently, especially after people touch your baby or before eating.\n5. Practice good hygiene: Wash your hands and your baby's hands frequently, especially after using public surfaces or before eating.\n\nRemember, it's okay to prioritize your own needs and your baby's needs when it comes to managing attention in public.

Be present and engaged: Spend quality time with your daughter, listen to her coos and babbles, and respond to her needs. This will help establish a strong bond and create a sense of security for her.\n2. Ask for help: Don't be afraid to reach out to your partner, family, and friends for support. They can offer valuable advice, provide a listening ear, and help with childcare duties.\n3. Take care of yourself: Remember to prioritize your own physical and mental health. A happy and healthy dad equals a happy and healthy baby!\n\nNot to do:\n\n1. Don't compare yourself to others: Every father is unique, and there's no one-size-fits-all approach to parenting. Avoid comparing yourself to others and focus on what works best for your family.\n2. Don't be too hard on yourself: It's okay to make mistakes and learn as you go. Remember that your daughter loves and accepts you unconditionally, even when you're not perfect.\n3. Don't neglect your partner: Parenting can be a challenging and exhausting journey, but it's important to prioritize your relationship with your partner as well. Make time for date nights, romantic getaways, and other activities that bring you both joy and closeness.\n\nRemember, fatherhood is a learning curve, and it's okay to ask for help and advice along the way.

Developmentally appropriate practice: The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children ages 3-5 years old spend time in high-quality early childhood programs that are developmentally appropriate, safe, and nurturing.

Socialization and friendships: The preschool setting provides opportunities for children to develop social skills, emotional intelligence, and friendships. These experiences can be beneficial for children's overall well-being and future success.\n3. Balance between school and home life: While the preschool provides structured learning and socialization, it's essential to maintain a balance between school and home life. The narrator may want to consider flexible scheduling or adjusting the number of school days to find the right balance for their child.\n4.

While it's understandable to feel frustrated and exhausted, it's important to remember that your son's behavior is likely a result of his teething discomfort and not a personal rejection of your parenting. Instead of resorting to the \"let them cry\" method, try picking him up and comforting him while he's in your arms. This may help soothe his discomfort and lead to a more peaceful bedtime. Additionally, consider using a teething ring or other soothing teething aids to help him cope with the discomfort. Remember to stay patient and consistent, and know that this phase will pass with time.\""}
{"Reddit ID": "l9mzi", "Reddit Post": "All kids go through it when they're toddlers, and so did she, but she got through it and became a happy, easygoing kid. This past year has been upsetting to her, though.\n\nUp until about a year ago she spent her days with her grandparents. Then they left the country for a while, and she started daycare, which she enjoyed... she had no issues being away from us all day. Her grandparents came back in February, and at the same time, her little brother was born. She went back to staying with the grandparents during the day for the whole spring; then in the summer, grandparents had to leave again. During the summer she started to throw tantrums, especially around eating, but we took it in stride, dealt with it, and things got better. She doesn't do that anymore, though like a lot of kids she just doesn't like to eat much. But she gets enough nutrition.\n\nHer grandparents (who live with us) have been back again since September, and ever since, she panics whenever grandma leaves the room, unless it's just part of her routine. Routine separations are no issue; she's all smiles when mom and I leave for work in the mornings, she goes to bed without fussing. But if someone has to step out unexpectedly, she breaks down.\n\nLast night grandma had to run an errand. In the midst of crying, my daughter sprinted across the room and tripped, of course prompting sympathy from grandma. But something seemed off - there was nothing to trip on where she fell - so in my most gentle and sympathetic voice, after she calmed down, I asked her about it. She volunteered that she fell over on purpose.\n\nEvery time, within minutes of someone leaving, she's fine again, and showing no outward signs of stress. She's not otherwise a \"clingy\" kid - she'll happily play by herself, we can put her in bed alone and she stays there.", "Sub-Reddit": "r_parenting", "Model": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "reappraisal_question": "Please help the narrator of the text reappraise the situation.

The fact that she is fine within minutes of someone leaving, but becomes distressed when they do, suggests that she may be struggling with the transition of having her grandparents leave the room. It's also possible that she may be using the tripping incident as a way to get attention and sympathy from her grandma.\n\nHere are a few strategies you could try to help your daughter cope with separation anxiety:\n\n1. Establish a consistent routine: Stick to a regular daily routine, including set times for meals, activities, and sleep. This can provide a sense of security and predictability for your daughter.\n2. Gradual separations: When dropping your daughter off at daycare or leaving her with her grandparents, try starting with small periods of time apart and gradually increasing the length of time as she becomes more comfortable.\n3. Open communication: Talk to your daughter about what she is feeling and reassure her that it's okay to feel scared or sad when someone leaves. Encourage her to express her feelings and listen to what she has to say.\n4. Offer comfort and reassurance: When your daughter becomes upset, offer her a comforting hug or reassuring words. Let her know that you are there for her and that everything will be okay.\n\nRemember, it's normal for young children to experience separation anxiety, and with patience, understanding, and consistent support, your daughter will likely grow out of this phase as she becomes more confident and secure."}

Make sure your child understands what is expected of them.\n3. Encourage empathy: Help your child develop empathy by discussing how their actions affected others.

Your response should be concise and brief.", "reappraisal_output": "Here's a reappraisal of the situation:\n\nYour daughter's nose-picking behavior is a common and normal response to stress and anxiety, especially in children. Her nervousness about starting a new school in a new state is understandable, and her reaction is a sign that she's feeling overwhelmed. Instead of being embarrassed or punishing her for this behavior, try to understand and validate her feelings. Encourage her to express her emotions in a healthy way, such as talking about her fears or excitement, and offer reassurance that it's okay to feel scared or nervous sometimes."}

{"Reddit ID": "qir67", "Reddit Post": "Hello, All~\n\nI've been invited to China for a month this summer (all of July) to teach English to middle school students and establish rapport with our \"sister city\" in XinJin.  My 8-year old son and 6-year old daughter may accompany me - they would be with a nanny 4-5 hours a day while I teach, and then we would have evenings/weekends to explore the city/country/etc.  \n\nThis is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me, and possibly my children, but I'm having anxiety...I need help convincing myself to do it.  Please help.  \n\nThings I'm worried about:\n\nFood - my children are picky eaters.  We could start experimenting with foods for the next few months.  \n\nTransportation - should we bring scooters?  Buy bicycles?  We currently live outside of Denver, \"entertainment\" - we live in a house, with a dog and a yard.  In China, we will live in a hotel.\n\nMeltdowns - my almost-6-year old had a major meltdown last night. \nI realized that she was hungry and tired, but as a single parent, I'm worried that the stress of being in a foreign country will put my right over the edge.  Obviously, I'll plan on bringing comfort items, as well as a laptop or tablet to communicate with friends and family back home.  \n\nSo, Reddit Parents - am I crazy for considering this trip to China with my kiddos?  Or, might this be an incredible experience", "Sub-Reddit": "r_parenting", "Model": "Llama-2-13b-chat-hf", "reappraisal_question": "Please help the narrator of the text reappraise the situation. Your response should be concise and brief.", "reappraisal_output": "No need to worry! Many families have successfully traveled to China with kids, and with proper planning, your trip can be just as smooth and enjoyable.\n\nFood: Introduce your kids to new foods gradually by trying Chinese dishes at home before your trip. Pack familiar snacks and comfort foods, too.\n\nTransportation: Renting scooters or bicycles could be a fun experience, but consider the safety concerns and the hassle of carrying them around. Public transportation in China is well-developed, so you can easily get around with your family.\n\nMeltdowns: As a single parent, it's understandable to worry about your child's meltdowns. However, with proper planning, including bringing comfort items and communication devices, you can minimize the risk of meltdowns and be better equipped to handle them if they do occur.\n\nOverall, this trip can be an incredible experience for your children, providing them with a unique cultural exposure and a chance to learn a new language. With proper planning and mindfulness, you can make the most of your time in China and create lifelong memories for your family."}

{"Reddit ID": "tldug", "Reddit Post": "He is too afraid of the dark so he won't even go by himself upstairs into his room, even though recently at 9pm when he sleeps it's not even fully dark outside yet. Maybe he's more afraid of going upstairs alone at night time (not necessarily afraid of the dark), or maybe he's more afraid of just being alone upstairs. I have to sit on the bed with him while he sleeps (putting him to sleep), and then I can safely walk away safely after he has fallen asleep completely. If I walk away 2 minutes into putting him to sleep, while he hasn't fallen asleep yet, he'll tell me 'please stay', almost begging me to stay. If I tell him to go up and sleep by himself, he refuses. If he stays up late downstairs, then he might just fall asleep on the sofa. This is becoming a headache and it wastes about 20-30 mins of my time every night while putting him to sleep.\n\nIt's been like this for years, I just figured one day he'll say 'ok I'm ready to do this on my own'. I want him to go up and fall asleep by himself.\n\nSo to sum up, he is scared of the night time and sleeping alone.

However, this has become a consistent routine that's wasting your time and not helping him overcome his fear. To solve this issue nicely and cleanly, you could start by gradually weaning him off of your presence during bedtime. For example, you could begin by sitting with him for only 10 minutes instead of 20-30, then gradually decrease the amount of time you spend with him until he's falling asleep on his own. Additionally, you could try reassuring him that it's okay to sleep alone and that you'll be there for him if he needs you. This will help him learn to self-soothe and develop healthy sleep habits."}

Community centers: These often have indoor playspaces or playgrounds that are designed for younger children.\n3. Children's museums: These museums often have interactive exhibits and play areas that are designed for young children.\n4.
