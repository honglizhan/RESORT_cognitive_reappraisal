<Self-responsibility> = If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person’s perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.
<Other-responsibility> = 
<Circumstances-responsibility> = 
<Problem-focused coping> = You should tell the narrator to focus on the problem at hand, and encourage them to ask themselves whether the issue is in their control or not. If any part of the issue is in their control, start breaking down the problem into manageable steps and develop a detailed plan to tackle each aspect (like a to-do list). If the narrator feels overwhelmed to do this alone, don’t hesitate to look for support from friends/family. Do not be overwhelmed by the scope of the issue; they could focus on the task they have narrowed down on the to-do list. Encourage them to find joy in striking off items from this list, focusing on the accomplishments. Without even realizing it, they will find themselves feeling empowered, having taken control of the situation. After accomplishing them, if needed re-evaluate the situation and repeat the process!
<Goal Relevance> = 
<Attentional activity> = You should tell the narrator to examine whether the situation at hand is worth their attention. If it’s not, encourage the narrator to focus on other important things. Encourage the narrator to find something that’s easier and less stressful to tackle.
<Emotionally cope> = You can ask the narrator to recognize what is upsetting them. Encourage the narrator to think of ways to reduce negative emotions, control their (negative) feelings, and avoid situations, individuals, objects, or memories that trigger such negative emotions or upset them.
<Self-controllable> = You can tell the narrator whether the situation is within their control (based on your (in third-person view) judgment). Guide the narrator on how to control the situation specifically: they can face it directly and find a solution, seek help from others (close friends, family, or professionals), or take a mental break and then re-evaluate the situation, whether it calls for their action (intervention) or not.
<Other-Controllable> = 
<Circumstances-Controllable> = 
<Predictability> = 
<Threat> = 
<Pleasantness> = 
<Certainty> = 
<Goal Conduciveness> = 
<Fairness> = 
<Worse/better (Future expectancy)> = 
<Consistency with social norms> = 
<Loss> = 
<Familiarity> = 
<Effort> = 
<Challenge> = 
<Consistency with internal values> = Tell the narrator that in situations where multiple people interact, conflicts of internal values may arise. What the narrator values is important; however, it may not always be suitable depending on the situation. Communicating amicably with others is vital if the situation aligns with the narrator's beliefs. On the other hand, if the situation contradicts the narrator's beliefs, it's essential to re-appraise the situation and think from others’ perspectives. For instance, if the narrator firmly believes that everyone should adopt a vegan lifestyle, it's important to acknowledge the validity of that viewpoint. Yet, remind the narrator that conflicts of interest and belief can arise in certain contexts, and misunderstandings might emerge due to a lack of context or background knowledge.
<Expectedness> =
