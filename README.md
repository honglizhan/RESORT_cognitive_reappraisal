## TL;DR
Using a series of psychologically grounded constitutions entitled RESORT<img src="https://github.com/honglizhan/RESORT_cognitive_reappraisal/assets/90797701/17516dc2-9e41-4733-9abd-4ce3ae9c1769" alt="RESORT" width="30" height="30">, we conduct a first-of-its-kind expert psychologist evaluation to explore LLMsâ€™ zero-shot ability to generate cognitive reappraisal responses.

## Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) have offered new opportunities for emotional support, and recent work has shown that they can produce empathic responses to people in distress. However, long-term mental well-being requires emotional self-regulation, where a one-time empathic response falls short. This work takes a first step by engaging with cognitive reappraisals, a strategy from psychology practitioners that uses language to targetedly change negative appraisals that an individual makes of the situation; such appraisals is known to sit at the root of human emotional experience. We hypothesize that psychologically grounded principles could enable such advanced psychology capabilities in LLMs, and design RESORT<img src="https://github.com/honglizhan/RESORT_cognitive_reappraisal/assets/90797701/17516dc2-9e41-4733-9abd-4ce3ae9c1769" alt="RESORT" width="30" height="30"> which consists of a series of reappraisal constitutions across multiple dimensions that can be used as LLM instructions. We conduct a first-of-its-kind expert evaluation (by clinical psychologists with M.S. or Ph.D. degrees) of an LLMâ€™s zero-shot ability to generate cognitive reappraisal responses to medium-length social media messages asking for support. This fine-grained evaluation showed that even LLMs at the 7B scale guided by RESORT<img src="https://github.com/honglizhan/RESORT_cognitive_reappraisal/assets/90797701/17516dc2-9e41-4733-9abd-4ce3ae9c1769" alt="RESORT" width="30" height="30"> are capable of generating empathic responses that can help users reappraise their situations.
